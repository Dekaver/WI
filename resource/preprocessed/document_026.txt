hook = sy.TorchHook(torch)
node1 = sy.VirtualWorker(hook, id="node1")
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28,28)),
tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')])
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
metrics=['accuracy'])
I tried like that code. But I had an AttributeError like that image. I don't know what is the error means. Why Sequential object has ho attribute 'send'? What should I do to solve this problem?
