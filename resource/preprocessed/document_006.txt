In this recommend system, if I define the variable item_id as 4 (for example) it will work perfectly. But if I use this:
item_id = int(st.number_input('Digite a id do livro:'))
... it will not work and will give me IndexError: list index out of range
even I use input instead of st.number_input it will work in the terminal.

Hi,  @Erick,
To solve the “index error: list index out of range” error, you should make sure that you’re not trying to access a non-existent item in a list.
If you are using a loop to access an item, make sure that the loop accounts for the fact that lists are indexed from zero. If that does not solve the problem, check to make sure that you are using range() to access each item by its index value.
