Problem:Hello all,I am new in python programming as well as this forum. I've enrolled in an online python programming course to develop my knowledge and skill. It is going quite well. However, I’ve written something very basic using the python language but the script is not working as it was supposed to do. In spite of that, it produces an error of: nameerror: name 'np' is not definedI am attaching the snippet here for your better understanding. Here it is…from numpy import *
n = np.random.randint(low=20, high=30, size=10)
print(n)And the error part isNameError: name 'np' is not definedWhat is the problem within it? Could you please explain it to me? I’ve searched the problem but unable to figure it out. I am hoping a legitimate solution. Thanks in advance for your kind help.

Solution:I’ve reviewed your script and the problem has pop um immediately. You can’t write the very fast line as it is in your script. Probably, you want to write the import line as:import numpy as np
The reason is,  from numpy import *, it imports every function resides in numpy, So, np is not a function of numpy, that’s why you have to Import numpy like import numpy as np, The other solution is,  you have to remove the np part ofnp.random.randint(low=20, high=30, size=10)and make it like this:random.randint(low=20, high=30, size=10)it's all since random is a function of numpy. I hope everything is clear to you now. Good Day!
