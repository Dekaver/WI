Why would a boolean ever be null?

@JonathanDoe That makes no sense. An object that doesn't exist simply doesn't exist.

@JonathanDoe I'm starting to detect a serious lack of effort here. For example, just tell me what to do despite numerous suggestions and not even bothering to google java initial value boolean. As a side note, whining about downvotes is not productive. Maybe take a second look at your question to see if it could be improved.

If you want to check whether "mybool" exists in the Bundle object:
if (!savedInstanceState.containsKey("mybool")) {
// your code here
}

The docs say that getBoolean(String key) returns a boolean, i.e. a primitive type. Primitive types are never null. In this case it's either true or false. Compared to the wrapper type Boolean, which can be null.
Furthermore, the docs say if the key isn't present, this method simply returns false.
If you want to check if mybool exists or not, use containsKey(String key) instead. (Again, refer to the docs)

Try to use Boolean instead of boolean i.e. use the Class instead if the primitive type. I do not recommend this though. Boolean should be either true or false.

This issue you are having is your understanding of how primitives work. Primitive types, including boolean, cannot be null. Even if you do not assign a value to them when you define the variable, there is a value assigned to them.
In the case of the primitive type boolean, the value is assigned as false when initialized if you do not assign a boolean value to the variable. See here for more information on how primitives are treated and what their default values are.
