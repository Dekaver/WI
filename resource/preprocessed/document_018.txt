Hi@akhtar,
If you trying to append data in your array, then you can use the below steps.
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1,1,2])
arr1 = np.append(arr,4)
arr1
array([1, 1, 2, 4])

Use numpy. append() to append an array to an empty array
empty_array = np. array([])
to_append = np. array([1, 2, 3])
combined_array = np. append(empty_array, to_append) append `to_append` to `empty_array`

for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
for file in files:
floc = file
im = Image.open(str(directory) + '\\' + floc)
pix = np.array(im.getdata())
pixels.append(pix)
labels.append(1)
# append(i)???
So far ok. But you want to leave pixels as a list until you are done with the iteration.
pixels = np.array(pixels)
labels = np.array(labels)
You had this indention right in your other question.
Iterating, collecting values in a list, and then at the end joining things into a bigger array is the right way. To make things clear I often prefer to use notation like:
alist = []
for ..
alist.append(...)
arr = np.array(alist)
If names indicate something about the nature of the object I'm less likely to get errors like yours.
I don't understand what you are trying to do with traindata. I doubt if you need to build it during the loop. pixels and labels have the basic information.
That
traindata = np.array([traindata[i][i],traindata[1]], dtype=object)
comes from the previous question. I'm not sure you understand that answer.
traindata = []
traindata.append(pixels)
traindata.append(labels)
if done outside the loop is just
traindata = [pixels, labels]
labels is a 1d array, a bunch of 1s (or [0,1,2,3...] if my guess is right). pixels is a higher dimension array. What is its shape?
Stop right there. There's no point in turning that list into an array. You can save the list with pickle.
