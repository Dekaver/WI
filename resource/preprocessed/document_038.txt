I try to import the following functions:
import numpy as np
def load_labels(path):
y = np.load(path)
return y
def print_sentence():
print("hi")
from a Jupyter notebook, with name "save_load" into another Jupyter notebook with the following code:
!pip install import-ipynb
import import_ipynb
import save_load
from save_load import load_labels, print_sentence
The function print_sentence works fine in the notebook, but with the function load_labels I receive the following error:
NameError: name 'np' is not defined
What could be the reason for this error? I've imported numpy as np in both notebooks.

In "save_load" instead of import numpy as np try import numpy, it worked for me.
