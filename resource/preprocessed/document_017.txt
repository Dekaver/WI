invalid literal for int() with base 10
The error message
invalid literal for int() with base 10
would seem to indicate that
you are passing a string that's not an integer to the
int() function .
In other words it's either empty, or has a character in it other than a digit.
int() method
The
int() method
is the python's inbuilt function which converts the given number or
string into an integer .
The default base is 10. This method return an
integer object
constructed from a number or string, or return 0 if no arguments are given.
But you get a
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10 , if you pass a string representation of a
float into int , or a string representation of anything but an integer (including empty string).
How to fix it?
Python isdigit()
You can solve this error by using
Python isdigit() method
to check whether the value is number or not. The
returns
True
if all the characters are digits, otherwise
False .
val = "10.10"
if val.isdigit():
print(int(val))
Using try-except
The other way to overcome this issue is to wrap your code inside a
Python try...except
block to handle this error.
str ='noninteger'
try:
int(str)
except:
print('Can not convert', str ,"to int")
Floating-Point Numbers
If you are trying to
convert a float
string (eg. "10.10") to an integer, simply calling float first then converting that to an int will work:
output = int(float(input))
The above code converts the string ("10.10") to a floating point value, which is then converted to an integer via truncation—that is, by discarding the
fractional part . Applying these functions to "10.10" will produce a result of 10. If, on the other hand, you wanted the
floating point value , just use only float().
Python2.x and Python3.x
Sometimes the difference between
Python2.x and Python3.x
that leads to this ValueError:
invalid literal for int() with base 10 .
With
Python2.x , int(str(3/2)) gives you "1". With
Python3.x , the same gives you ("1.5"): ValueError: invalid literal for
int()
with base 10: "1.5".
Python is pretty good at abstracting this away from you, most other language also have double precision floating point numbers, for instance, but you don't need to worry about that. Since 3.0, Python will also automatically convert integers to floats if you divide them, so it's actually very easy to work with.
Computers store numbers in a variety of different ways.
Python
has two main ones. Integers, which store
whole numbers
ie integers, and floating point numbers, which store
real numbers . "base 10" means that you count from
0 to 9. You need to use the right one based on what you require.
