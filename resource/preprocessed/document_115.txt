I am on the latest Poetry version.
I have searched the issues of this repo and believe that this is not a duplicate.
OS version and name: Fedora 32
Poetry version: 1.1.5
Issue
In branch 1.1 there are two incorrect concatenation between int and string
poetry/poetry/mixology/incompatibility.py
Lines 243 to 244
in
24fcaf9
if this_line is not None:
buffer.append(" " + this_line)
poetry/poetry/mixology/incompatibility.py
Lines 248 to 249
in
24fcaf9
if other_line is not None:
buffer.append(" " + other_line)
Those concatenation are already fixed in master where they has been correctly casted in the string concatenation
poetry/poetry/mixology/incompatibility.py
Lines 257 to 258
in
a12d142
if this_line is not None:
buffer.append(" " + str(this_line))
poetry/poetry/mixology/incompatibility.py
Lines 262 to 263
in
a12d142
if other_line is not None:
buffer.append(" " + str(other_line))
I suggest to port this fix in branch 1.1 or anyway in any new release.
