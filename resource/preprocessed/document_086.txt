I was following a tutorial on setting up a class for an example of making a bar bill and cant figure out why i got error when adding new item to the bill
'dict' object has no attribute 'append'
The code
class Bar_tab:
#dictionary
menu = {
'wine':5,
'beer':2,
'coke':3,
'chicken':9,
'dessert':7
}
#set up the class
def __init__(self):
#set up empty initial total and item list
#customer will add items and total will add up
#these variables will exist within the class
self.total = 0
self.items = {}
#function for add items to tab
def add(self,item):
self.items.append(item)
#add the value from menu dictionary for the 'item'
self.total += self.menu[item]
def pay_bill (self,tax,service):
#tax will only exist within this function in the class
tax=(tax/100) *self.total
service=(service/100)*self.total
total=self.total + tax + service
for items in self.items:
print(f'{item} ${self.menu[item]}')
print(f'Total is ${total}')`
Error was on the self.items.append(item) line

append() is normally done to lists, not dictionaries since they are not ordered.
You also need a key and a value, you only have item.
Check your tutorial again!

self.items is a dictionary. Make it a list and it should work (change self.item = {} to self.item = []).

That should also probably be for item in self.items:

self.item = {} initializes self.items to an empty dictionary. A dictionary does not have an append() method because its primary purpose is to associate keys with values. Looking at the code, the intention is for self.menu to be a dict (mapping menu items to prices) and self.items to be a list (of bill items), and list does have an append method.
To intialize self.items as an empty list instead, modify the assignment to:
self.item = []

Thank you for the comments and answer!
I edited self.items to be a list but i got another error instead
AttributeError: 'Bar_tab' object has no attribute 'append'.
I only changed that part
def __init__(self):
self.total = 0
self.items = []

@NoodlexPoodle Please don't take this the wrong way, but you need to be aware that StackOverflow is not a substitute for learning materials - the idea is not that we debug your code for you, but that we help you with concrete problems that could be relevant to others. If you want to, you can ask a separate question, but please first try debugging the issue yourself, or working through a Python tutorial.

somehow it worked after i tried today! thanks. i think could be because when i previously tried, I did not exit and restart terminal after i edited the code so the cache of the code in terminal didnt change. thank you
