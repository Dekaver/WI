What is returned from that function when the for loop doesn't do anything? It's exactly what the error message is telling you. Why did you feel the need to post so much code that has nothing to do with your problem?

Come on!!!
Can't you read error messages and trace?
Quote:Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Uncompilable source code - missing return statement
It means you have a method somewhere that does not return a value, but should...So it can not be compiled...
Quote:at javaapplication19.Student.getGPA(Student.java:52)
This one tells you where you missed the return...
Now looking into getGPA...
JavaCopy Code
public double getGPA() {
// ...
for (int i = 0; i < number; i++) {
// ...
return GPA;
}
}
Now, who told you it will enter the for loop?

Because there is no k variable initialised anywhere. You should go back to your study notes and look more closely at classes and object. It would also help you to use meaningful variable names rather than single letters.
