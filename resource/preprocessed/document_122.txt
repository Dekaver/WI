Hello!
I am running a simulation of DF and VSC with Honeybee and i get the “Solution exception:‘int’ object is not iterable” error message.
Has anybody faced the same problem?

What is the full error message in readMe? One of the inputs is not set correctly but it’s hard to say which one without seeing the full error message.

Hello @mostapha!
Actually it was a minor problem, i just needed to change the directory path on the “run Daylight analysis” component. Works all fine now!
Thanks
