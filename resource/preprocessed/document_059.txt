I am creating a loop in order to append continuously values from user input to a dictionary but i am getting this error:
AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'append'
This is my code so far:
for index, elem in enumerate(main_feeds):
print(index,":",elem)
temp_list = index,":",elem
li = {}
print_user_areas(li)
while True:
n = (input('\nGive number: '))
if n == "":
break
else:
if n.isdigit():
n=int(n)
print('\n')
print (main_feeds[n])
temp = main_feeds[n]
for item in user:
user['areas'].append[temp]
Any ideas?

Well, a dict doesn't have an append method. And even if it did, you couldn't call it with square brackets.

use defaultdict instead (with list in it)

You assign values to a dict using its key like this : user['areas'] = temp. Your code would only work IF user[areas] was already a list. If you need it to be a list, construct the list first, THEN assign that list to the key.

Like the error message suggests, dictionaries in Python do not provide an append operation.
You can instead just assign new values to their respective keys in a dictionary.
mydict = {}
mydict['item'] = input_value
If you're wanting to append values as they're entered you could instead use a list.
mylist = []
mylist.append(input_value)
Your line user['areas'].append[temp] looks like it is attempting to access a dictionary at the value of key 'areas', if you instead use a list you should be able to perform an append operation.
Using a list instead:
user['areas'] = []
On that note, you might want to check out the possibility of using a defaultdict(list) for your problem. See here

Dictionaries in Python do provide an update method though.
So, if you want to add more key-value pairs: dict.update({'another_key': 'another_value'}).
Maybe of value here.
update will overwrite existing keys of the same name, so caveat emptor.

Very true Matt! Although, it looks like they're trying to just append values here.

Either
use dict.setdefault() if the key is not added yet to dictionary :
dict.setdefault(key,[]).append(value)
or use, if you already have the keys set up:
dict[key].append(value)
