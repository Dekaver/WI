I have a Python notebook that used to work before without problems.
Now if I try to run it, I get an "NameError: name 'nltk' is not defined" error.
I'm not sure what has changed since on my system.
I tried so far:
Installing nltk library with pip
Downloading nltk library with python interpreter
pip3 install nltk
Requirement already satisfied: nltk in /Applications/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages (3.5)
python
>>>import nltk
>>>nltk.download('all')
$ which python python2 python3
/Applications/anaconda3/bin/python
/usr/bin/python2
/Applications/anaconda3/bin/python3
$ which pip pip2 pip3
/Applications/anaconda3/bin/pip
/Applications/anaconda3/bin/pip3
$ python3 --version
Python 3.8.3
$ echo $PATH
/Applications/anaconda3/bin:/Applications/anaconda3/condabin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Users/testimo/.rvm/bin:/Users/testimo/.rvm/bin
Is this path wrong? How can I fix it?
Or any other tips? Thank you!

This happens with me; but when I use Google Colab or change the directory to where the python files are, this resolves the issue. You should make a new folder (remember not to make a subfolder in the existing ones) and move the files into it.

HuggingFace Saving-Loading Model (Colab) to Make Predictions
Using HuggingFace to train a transformer model to predict a target variable (e.g., movie ratings). I'm new to Python and this is likely a simple question, but I canâ€™t figure out how to save a trained classifier model (via Colab) and then reload so to make target variable predictions on new data. As an example, I trained a model to predict imbd ratings with an example from the HuggingFace resources, shown below. Iâ€™ve tried a number of ways (save_model, save_pretrained) and either am struggling to save it at all or when loaded, canâ€™t figure out what to call to get predictions. Any help would be incredibly appreciated on the steps that involve saving, loading, then creating new predicted scores based on the model on test data.
#example mainly from here: https://huggingface.co/transformers/training.html
!pip install transformers
!pip install datasets
from datasets import load_dataset
raw_datasets = load_dataset("imdb")
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-cased")
def tokenize_function(examples):
return tokenizer(examples["text"], max_length = 128, padding="max_length", truncation=True)
tokenized_datasets = raw_datasets.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)
#choosing small datasets for example#
small_train_dataset = tokenized_datasets["train"].shuffle(seed=42).select(range(1000))
small_eval_dataset = tokenized_datasets["test"].shuffle(seed=42).select(range(500))
### TRAINING classification ###
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-cased", num_labels=2)
from transformers import TrainingArguments
from transformers import Trainer
training_args = TrainingArguments("test_trainer", evaluation_strategy="epoch", num_train_epochs=2, weight_decay=.0001, learning_rate=0.00001, per_device_train_batch_size=32)
trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=small_train_dataset, eval_dataset=small_eval_dataset)
trainer.train()
y_test_predicted_original = model_loaded.predict(small_eval_dataset)
#### Saving ###
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/gdrive')
%cd /content/gdrive/My\ Drive/FOLDER
trainer.save_pretrained ("Trained model") #assumed this would save but did not
model.save_pretrained ("Trained model") #did save
### Loading Model and Creating Predicted Scores ###
#perhaps this....#
from transformers import BertConfig, BertModel
conf = BertConfig.from_pretrained("Trained model", num_labels=2)
model_loaded = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("Trained model", config=conf)
#or...#
model_loaded = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("Trained model", local_files_only=True)
model_loaded
#with ultimate goal of getting predicted scores (not sure what to call here)...
y_test_predicted_loaded = model_loaded.predict(small_eval_dataset)
What is the regex pattern for repeating and non-repeating text sequences?
Here is an example of the text and description of desired matching groups.
The text example is as follows that represents color, size and quantity information.
NAVY BLUE: XS-5
NAVY BLUE: S-30, M-10, L-15, XL-35
I would ideally like to have a match for the color text, and a matching group for all the size-quantity pairs. I can either get the color and the first size-qty pair, or all the size-qty pairs but not color. Any hint or guidance is appreciated!
By using multiple checkboxes in html, how should I fetch the data and store in the database in django?
I am creating multiple checkboxes in html and now I want to fetch this data and store it in the database. I'm using MySQL as the database and I'm using the django-multiselectfield(django-multiselectfield) library in django for creating checkboxes in django.
models.py file ðŸ‘‡
from multiselectfield import MultiSelectField
from django.db import models
class Teacher(models.Model):

('CBSE', 'CBSE'),
('ICSE', 'ICSE'),
]
school_board = MultiSelectField(choices=SCHOOL_BOARD_CHOICES, blank=True, null=True)

CommandNotFoundError: No command 'conda envs'. Did you mean 'conda env'?
As of conda 4.10.1, here is what worked for me using the Git Bash terminal in Sublime text 3 (same for cmd and Git cmd) on Windows:
Note that I installed two version of python , the original python (3.8.6) and the Anaconda version (with python 3.8.8), and both version are added to my path:
C:\Users\sohaib\anaconda3
C:\Users\sohaib\anaconda3\Scripts
C:\Users\sohaib\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32\Scripts\
when I try to execute this command conda --info envs I get this error
CommandNotFoundError: No command 'conda envs'.
Did you mean 'conda env'?
but this command conda env list work good and display conda environments normally
how to fix this problem?
Python version 2.7 despite conda 3.6 environment
I am using Ubuntu 16 and conda 4.9.2. I created an environment with
$ conda create --name py36 python=3.6.2
The above python version is available at
$ conda search python
But the following gives wrong output.
$ conda activate py36
(py36) $ python --version
Python 2.7.12
I tried to implement the solution here
But there is no folder named 'bin' at
/anaconda3/envs/py36
I then tried the solution here which suggests
$ pip uninstall virtualenvwrapper
The error is:
ImportError: No module named typing
Then I tried to install typing
$ pip install typing
I get the same import error.
How to solve this and create environment with specified version?
regarding the possible approaches of performing conda install locally due to the firewall issue
I was trying to install python packages in the anaconda, and it got the followign errow messages. I
think it is because our organization just update our firewall system. Are there any ways to use conda install locally, e.g., download related anaconda package, and install it locally. If it is possible, how to do it? Thanks.

How can I get two txt files by finding common occurrences?
I need to know which English words were used in the Italian chat and to count how many times they were used.
But in the output I also have the words I didn't use in the example chat (baby-blue-eyes': 0)
english_words = {}
with open("dizionarioen.txt") as f:
for line in f:
for word in line.strip().split():
english_words[word] = 0
with open("_chat.txt") as f:
for line in f:
for word in line.strip().split():
if word in english_words:
english_words[word] += 1
print(english_words)
How to tokenize and POS tag 70,000 sentences and display in a specific format?
I have a CSV file with one column having a sentence in each row. This has about 70,000 sentences. I want to tokenize each sentence and then find the POS tag for each token. But at the end of it, I want a CSV file with the following format. I have already tried the NLTK libraries and they work, but I can't get it output in this specific format. Does anybody know how to?
I have added a picture above, to show the sample output format. Ignore the words and POS Tags, I filled them in to just fill the space.
