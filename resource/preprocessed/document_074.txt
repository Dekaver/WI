>>> myList[1]
'from form'
>>> myList[1].append(s)
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<pyshell#144>", line 1, in <module>
myList[1].append(s)
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'append'
>>>
Why myList[1] is considered a 'str' object? mList[1] returns the first item in the list 'from form' but I cannot append to item 1 in the list myList. Thank you.
Edit01:
@pyfunc: Thank you for the explanation; now I understand.
I need to have a list of lists; so 'from form' should be a list. I did this (please correct if this not the right way):
>>> myList
[1, 'from form', [1, 2, 't']]
>>> s = myList[1]
>>> s
'from form'
>>> s = [myList[1]]
>>> s
['from form']
>>> myList[1] = s
>>> myList
[1, ['from form'], [1, 2, 't']]
>>>

myList[1] is an element of myList and it's type is string.
myList[1] is str, you can not append to it.
myList is a list, you should have been appending to it.
>>> myList = [1, 'from form', [1,2]]
>>> myList[1]
'from form'
>>> myList[2]
[1, 2]
>>> myList[2].append('t')
>>> myList
[1, 'from form', [1, 2, 't']]
>>> myList[1].append('t')

If you want to append a value to myList, use myList.append(s).
Strings are immutable -- you can't append to them.

Why myList[1] is considered a 'str' object?
Because it is a string. What else is 'from form', if not a string? (Actually, strings are sequences too, i.e. they can be indexed, sliced, iterated, etc. as well - but that's part of the str class and doesn't make it a list or something).
mList[1] returns the first item in the list 'from form'
If you mean that myList is 'from form', no it's not!!! The second (indexing starts at 0) element is 'from form'. That's a BIG difference. It's the difference between a house and a person.
Also, myList doesn't have to be a list from your short code sample - it could be anything that accepts 1 as index - a
dict with 1 as index, a list, a tuple, most other sequences, etc. But that's irrelevant.
but I cannot append to item 1 in the list myList
Of course not, because it's a string and you can't append to string. String are immutable. You can concatenate (as in, "there's a new object that consists of these two") strings. But you cannot append (as in, "this specific object now has this at the end") to them.

Thanks for the explanation; now I understand that myList[1] is the string "from form".

What you are trying to do is add additional information to each item in the list that you already created so
alist[ 'from form', 'stuff 2', 'stuff 3']
for j in range( 0,len[alist]):
temp= []
temp.append(alist[j]) # alist[0] is 'from form'
temp.append('t') # slot for first piece of data 't'
temp.append('-') # slot for second piece of data
blist.append(temp)
# will be alist with 2 additional fields for extra stuff assocated with each item in alist

This is simple program showing append('t') to the list.
n=['f','g','h','i','k']
for i in range(1):
temp=[]
temp.append(n[-2:])
temp.append('t')
print(temp)
Output: [['i', 'k'], 't']

Instead you can use the += syntax:
a = "prin"
a.append("T") #doesn't wok
a += "t" #works
