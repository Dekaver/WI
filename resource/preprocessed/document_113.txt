How can I call a non static method in main class.I am getting the folowing error in my sample console application
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Uncompilable source code - non-static method doSomthing() cannot be referenced from a static context
at sample.Main.main(Main.java:20)
and the code is,
public class Main
{
/**
* @param args the command line arguments
*/
public static void main(String[] args) {
doSomthing();
System.out.print("From Main");
}
protected void doSomthing()
{
System.out.print("From Main doSomthing");

Why would you want to call a non static method from a static one?

problem is you have used non static method in static method which is not allowed in java , change doSomthing() as static method
protected static void doSomthing()
{
System.out.print("From Main doSomthing");
}
Or Create an object of Main class and call it
public static void main(String[] args) {
Main myMain = new Main();
myMain.doSomthing();
System.out.print("From Main");
}

thanks.so in a console application all methods should be in static. Is it?

you can create a object of that class and call your methods not always it should be static.

You could create an instance first from your static main method:
new Main().doSomthing();

You can't call a non static method in main class, unless you instantiate one [Main class].
