on DN DN
Cause:
The server could not allocate sufficient memory
to complete the operation.
Solution:
Make sure enough memory is available, and
then restart the server.
8310: Protocol error: [C]
Detected unsupported operation (operation) in replay
changes request
Cause:
The server received an operation that is not
supported for this version.
Solution:
Make sure that the servers in your replication
topology use compatible versions of the replication protocol. You may be running
a legacy version of the server that uses an outdated version of the replication
protocol.
8311: Unexpected operation
sequence number value (expecting value).
Cause:
An internal error occurred in the sequencing
of replicated operations.
Solution:
Contact Sun Technical Support.
8312: Replay of pending
changes failed returning.
Cause:
The replicated change could not be applied on
this consumer.
Solution:
Check the error code. A delete operation
may generate a return code of 32 - this error code is harmless (a dependency
of changes between several masters).
If the error persists, contact
Sun Technical Support.
8313: Internal Error: [C]
Decoding of group of changes failed, returning error-code
Cause:
An incorrectly encoded group of replication
changes caused a protocol error.

a response instead of a request
Cause:
A response was received when a request was expected.
Solution:
Contact Sun Technical Support.
8315: [C] Failed to add
op op_num csn CSN to
the pending list (err=code)
Cause:
One of the following:
The configuration on the consumer is invalid.
The consumer is not initialized.
An attempt was made to write to a read-only replica.
The change involved has already been applied.
Solution:
Verify that the replica is of the proper
type.
Solution:
Check the configuration on the consumer replica.
Initialize the consumer if necessary.
8318: [S] Bind failed with
response: error_code.
Cause:
Authentication failed. This may be due to an
invalid host and port combination, an invalid identity, or the fact that the
consumer is down.
Solution:
Check the error code and fix the replication
agreement. It may be necessary to restart the consumer.
8319: [S] Start Failed with
response: error_code.
Cause:
Replication was unable to start. This is likely
to be caused by an error in the replication configuration.
Solution:
Check the error log for more information.
Also check the error logs on the consumers.
8320: [S] End Failed with
response: error_code.
Cause:
Replication was unable to end. This may be because
a network outage has occurred, the consumer is down, or the consumer has already
dropped the connection.
Solution:
Check the error log for more information.
Also check the error logs on the consumers.
8321: Failed to close
old changelog file file-name DB error error-code - error-message

A database error occurred.
Solution:
Depending on the database error specified,
you may need to initialize the replica.
8324: [C] Consumer has
decided to prioritize a total update regarding incremental sessions
Cause:
An initialization request has priority over
other replication sessions.
Solution:
None.
8325: replica_write_partial_repl_checksum:
failed to update partial repl checksum with value (value)
(error-message LDAP error - error-code)
Cause:
The server encountered a problem writing an
attribute value inside the replica entry.
Solution:
Although possibly harmless while the server
is up and running, this might become a serious error that could lead to a
break in replication next time the server is restarted. This is because the
value of an important replication configuration attribute could not be stored
persistently in the Directory Server configuration. To try to work around
this issue, stop the server immediately and check the cn=replica entry
for this suffix found in the Directory Server configuration file. If the
attribute dsfilterspconfigchecksum is already present in
the entry, then use the value included in the errors log. If dsfilterspconfigchecksum is not present yet in the entry, use the value suggested in the
errors log. Then restart the server.
8326: replica_write_partial_repl_checksum:
failed to update last init timestamp with value (value)
(error-message LDAP error - error-code)
Cause:
The server encountered a problem writing an
attribute value inside the replica entry.
Solution:
Although possibly harmless while the server
is up and running, this might become a serious error that could lead to a
break in replication next time the server is restarted. This is because the
value of an important replication configuration attribute could not be stored
persistently in the Directory Server configuration. To try to work around
this issue, stop the server immediately and check the cn=replica entry
for this suffix found in the Directory Server configuration file. If the

the server.
8331: Unable to demote
a hub to a read-only replica if some replication agreements are enabled
Cause:
The server could not be demoted to a dedicated
consumer role.
Solution:
First eliminate the replication agreements
that call for updates from the hub.
12289: PR_Accept() failed
error variable (variable)
Cause:
The problem depends on the variable and
is based on the Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) error layer.
Solution:
If you determine that the cause of the problem
is that the TCP port to which you are attempting to bind is already in use,
consider the following actions.
Restart the server, using a different port.
Stop the application bound to that port and restart the server.

on.
Cause:
The LDAP port is missing from the configuration.
Solution:
Add an LDAP port to the configuration file
or use the command line.
12292: Unable to create
time thread (variable - variable) - shutting down.
Cause:
System error, probably due to a resource problem.
Solution:
Free up resources on the machine and restart
the server.
12293: Too many open file
descriptors - not listening on new connection.
Cause:
There is an error in the configuration file.
See the reservedfd attribute.
Solution:
Increase the maximum number of file descriptors
(in the configuration file) by increasing the value of nsslapd-maxdescriptors. Otherwise, check the Directory Server configuration and reduce
the resource usage (number of threads, and number of backends, for example.)
12294: Not enough descriptors
to accept any additional connections.
Cause:
There are insufficient file descriptors to accept
new connections. This may be because:
the value of the maxdescriptors attribute
is too small
the hard limit on descriptors is too small
the value of the reservedescriptors attribute
is too large
Solution:
Increase the number of file descriptors available
to the slapd process.
The error log displays
the number of file descriptors currently available to the slapd process,
and the number of descriptors reserved for internal slapd use.
The total number of file descriptors available to the process must be greater
than variable
