So i'm trying to code a simple website form. But it has this htmlspecialchars error.
I've tried to make {{ $message }} but it didn't work. has the same error.
this is my controller :
<?php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;
use Mail;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
class ContactMessageController extends Controller
{
public function create()
{
return view('form');
}
public function store(Request $request)
{
$this->validate($request, [
'name' => 'required',
'email' => 'required|email',
'address' => 'required',
]);
Mail::send('emails.contact-message', [
'message' => $request->message
], function($mail) use($request) {
$mail->from($request->email, $request->name);
$mail->to('john@example.com')->subject('Contact message');
});
return redirect()->back()->with('flash_message', 'thanks');
}
}
and this is my blade
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8" />
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

Have you tried checking what $message contains? Does the error even come from that specific variable?

Well, you could use var_dump, echo, maybe Symfony's dump works, more sophisticated approaches would start with XDebug - I don't want to be rude, and I don't want to sound arrogant, but that is basic craftmanship that you need to learn to get more efficient in programming. You will see that it pays out quickly :)

Just change the array key from message to messages in your controller like below:
$data = array(
'messages' => $request->message
);
and also in the blade print it as {{$messages}}
A $message variable is always passed to e-mail views, and allows
the inline embedding of attachments. So, it is best to avoid passing a
message variable in your view payload.
Check the note in this link: http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/mail#basic-usage

Thanks! This applies to Laravel 5.8 and this entry about the $message was removed from the documentation. Not sure why...

They should somehow say these kinds of stuff in the debug page. I searched everywhere and tried many methods to send data. Oh my god.

You should try this:
public function store(Request $request)
{
$this->validate($request, [
'name' => 'required',
'email' => 'required|email',
'address' => 'required',
]);
$fromName = $request->name;
$subject = "MailSent";
$data = array(
'message' => $request->message
);
$fromEmail = $request->email;
$toName = 'test';
$toEmail = 'john@example.com';
Mail::send('emails.contact-message', $data, function($message) use ($toEmail, $toName, $fromEmail, $fromName, $subject){
$message->from($fromEmail, $fromName);
$message->to($toEmail, $toName);
$message->subject($subject);
});
return redirect()->back()->with('flash_message', 'thanks');
}
}
