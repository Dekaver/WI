Hi!
I tried the example notebook and encounterd the error below.
The libraries are
scvelo==0.1.3+1.g7af8818, Scanpy==1.3.1, anndata==0.6.10 , numpy==1.15.1 , scipy==1.0.0,
pandas==0.23.4 , scikit-learn==0.19.1 , statsmodels==0.9.0
The dot function applied is disturbing the type of csr. or should I specify some libraries?
I'm appreciating your works and looking forward the advance of scvelo and scanpy every single day.
Best regards.

Thanks for pointing that out.
The data would preferably be read sparsely, i.e. set sparse=True. The case of using dense data in tl.moments is fixed now as well.
👍
