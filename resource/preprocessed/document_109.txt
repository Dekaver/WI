Description
Name: nt126004			Date: 05/23/2002
FULL PRODUCT VERSION :
java version "1.4.0"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.0-b92)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.0-b92, mixed mode)
OS:
linux kernel 2.4.18 glibc 2.2.4
redhat 7.2
A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM :
Technically it is not incorrect to report a divide by zero error, I just think it would be make life simpler if the exception indicated the error is from a modulus rather than a normal division.
STEPS TO FOLLOW TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM :
compile and run the source.
EXPECTED VERSUS ACTUAL BEHAVIOR :
It throws:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
at t.main(t.java:5)
Whereas I'd rather see
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: % by zero
at t.main(t.java:5)
or
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / (%) by zero
at t.main(t.java:5)
---------- BEGIN SOURCE ----------
public class t
{
static public void main(String [] arg)
{
System.out.println(""+1%0);
}
}
---------- END SOURCE ----------

EVALUATION
This really isn't a trivial fix because even though the string only appears in a few places, it's because it's associated with throw_ArithmeticException so lrem would have to throw a different Arithmetic exception in the VM to have a different string.
It's not that hard but I have to agree with the David's comment that the potential harm and the age of this request makes it not worth changing.
It's not a typical message that users will get.

Not an unreasonable request; vm changes would be required.
