Typeerror: 'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer

Problem:Hi there! I am a noob and I have got an assignment in which I have to take two numbers as input from users and print the even numbers that lie between two numbers. I wrote the following program:starting = input("Enter the starting number: ")
ending = input("Enter the ending number: ")
print("Even numbers between ",starting, " and ",ending," are: \n")
for i in range(starting,ending):
if (i % 2 == 0):
print(i)
When I run this code I get the following output error:Enter the starting number: 4
Enter the ending number: 2
Even numbers between
4
and
2
are:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "main.py", line 13, in <module>
for i in range(starting,ending):
TypeError: 'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integerI have no idea what is wrong with my program. Can anybody here help me?

Solution:Hello! You need to parse the input you are taking from the user to a number data type. When the input is taken from the user, its data type is always a string and it is needed to be converted to another type. In Python, typecasting is done as follows:variable = (datatype) valueTry replacing your code with following code:starting = int(input("Enter the starting number: "))
ending = int(input("Enter the ending number: "))
print("Even numbers between ",starting, " and ",ending," are: \n")
for i in range(starting,ending):
if (i % 2 == 0):
print(i)
I hope you got the concept!

Typeerror: 'nonetype' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
Problem: I have a nested list with elements. I want the user to remove one list when he/she types an index of the list: So let's say the user types: "0" so ['elem', 'elem1', 'elem2'] will be deleted. 0 ['elem', 'elem1', 'elem2'] 1 ['elem3', 'elem4', ' ... (f"removed: {result}") Could someone please tell me what this error means? Does it mean that the index is not actually an int? How can I fix it?
