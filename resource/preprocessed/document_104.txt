I am not able to initialize empty dictionary in python33.
I have tried:
Expand|Select|Wrap|Line Numbers
D=dict()
D={}
Later i want to insert values using:
Expand|Select|Wrap|Line Numbers
D.setdefault(num).append(ansdb2.Rname)
In both cases i am getting error "NoneType' object has no attribute 'append'"

It should be empty brackets as a second parameter to setdefault:
Expand|Select|Wrap|Line Numbers
D.setdefault(num, []).append(ansdb2.Rname)
