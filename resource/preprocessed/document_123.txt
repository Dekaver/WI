"Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 0, Size: 0" is the main error I get when I compile this method:
public static ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> createSparseArray(int len, double den) {
int counter = 0;
ArrayList<Integer> placeHolder = new ArrayList<Integer>();
for (int j = 0; j < len; j++) {
double randomNumber = Math.random();
if (randomNumber < den) {
counter++;
placeHolder.add(j);
}
}
ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> list = new ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>();
for (int k = 0; k < counter; k++) {
for (int m = 0; m < 2; m++) {
list.get(0).set(placeHolder.get(k), (int) (Math.random() * (99999) + 1));
}
}
return list;
}
How can I fix this?

The new list doesn't contain any item in it. list.get(0) will result in Exception. First add the empty ArrayList in list then use it.

ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> list doesnt contain any element in (0)th postion
and the compiler throws out of bounds exception on iterating when it doesn't find any element in the specified postion.
when you try executing list.get(0).set(placeHolder.get(k), (int) (Math.random() * (99999) + 1)); statement , your list doesnt contain any element inside it. you need to iterate the inner list to set the values for the list.

where OP is iterating empty list? Iterating empty list doesn't throw this Exception.

Do not use list.set(index, element) on a nonexistent element, since it replaces the old (nonexistent) element with a new one and returns the old one. Instead, use list.add(index, element) and it will work.

I thingk u have mistake here
list.get(0).set(placeHolder.get(k), (int) (Math.random() * (99999) + 1));
The java.util.ArrayList.get(int index) method returns the element at the specified position in this list.
You are setting just to first element in the list arrray

Here, the main problem is Array indexing and real logic indexing difference...
Start with facts that ArrayList not start with index 0
*
but in your logic when you use X.add("Y") with i = 0 then logic can not find place 0 or can not recover position element 0;
*
that means ... it show indexing error of outbound;
solution ;
first solution : use i< istead of i<=
second solution : use i = 1 for initialization instead of i = 0;
