questionsurllib.error.HTTPError: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden
Hi all,
I'm aware that there are some older issues with the same error, howevery I thought I would just give it a try. For some videos (like this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=393C3pr2ioY ) I get a 403 error...others work fine though. Do you know of any workaround for that? I saw this thread in the older issue https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16627227/http-error-403-in-python-3-web-scraping but I'm not good enough in Python to find the right spot to implement it. Any help would be appreciated.
PS: I already updated to the most current version (9.5.0).

I'm doing something wrong...
In line for of request.py:
from urllib import request
then line 22/23:
req = request(url, headers = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"})
response = urlopen(req)
now I'm getting this error:
self.watch_html = request.get(url=self.watch_url)
File "C:\Users\janvo\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\lib\site-packages\pytube\request.py", line 22, in get
req = request(url, headers = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"})
TypeError: 'module' object is not callable
useful!
