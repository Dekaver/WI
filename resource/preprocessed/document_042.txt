Hi i am trying to clean up the column here converting this column to date, but am afraid i was not able to get it.
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from datetime import datetime as dt
%matplotlib inline
This is part of the info for the columns.
S/N
44 non-null int64
Date
44 non-null object
Time of Reporting
44 non-null object
Month
44 non-null int64
When i try this
fraud['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(fraud['Date'], format='%Y%m%d')
i get the following error message
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError

Hello @willx,
One of the errors in your code is that you put the wrong format. Either change the format value to format='%Y-%m-%d' or do not include the format parameter.
Let me know if this helps.

and also removing the format. Still hittting the same problem.

That’s really weird. I get these types of errors when there’s a typo in the column name I try to refer to.
I would check the fraud.columns attribute to see if there’s a space character
or something like that…

@willx,
Check out what I did with the file you uploaded:
DQ.ipynb (7.3 KB)
BTW, is this all the values you have in the Date column?Click here to view the jupyter notebook file in a new tab

hi all, i convert the file a csv file and read from the csv file and it works.
earlier i was facing problems reading from the csv file due to tokenizing data problem which is why i tried xlsx.
i guess excel contains some hidden characters or formatting that prevents the reading of the string column. thank you so much guys for your help and time
