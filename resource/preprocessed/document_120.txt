No, you aren't trying to compile that code. That error message happens when you try to run the code before successfully compiling it.
I expect you are using some kind of IDE like NetBeans maybe. So review the compiler errors before you click the Run button.

No, if you use IDEs regularly, you will see that sort of message frequently. We have an FAQ about it.
If you look at the code, you will see little red marks against some lines. Those are where the compiler errors are
