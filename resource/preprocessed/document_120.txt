Not really sure what issue is, I ran your code with no issues (Both on Python 3.4 and 3.7.1). dog resulted in bme when encrypting, and vice versa when decrypting. You should change your while loop condition though, you are currently checking for 0 integer value but when user enters their choice it will be '0' as a string.

you're probably making a sum '+' operation with a string and an integer variable. Also try to be more clear and specific in your question and show what you have tried so far. You can add your code to your question and look for the line the error shows.
Adding this info here because i still don't have enough rep to comment.

The location of the closing parenthesis is wrong for ord in route of choice=='2'
Your code:
chr(ord(message[i] + 2))
Correct one:
chr(ord(message[i]) + 2)
You got the error because you do + operation before you cast character to integer.

Maybe you are missing close parenthesis. Your code result = result + chr(ord(message[i] + 2) has no closing parenthesis for chr.

Grand tour (cyclisme)
Pour les articles homonymes, voir Grand tour.
En cyclisme sur route, le terme «  grand tour  » fait référence à l'une des trois courses les plus prestigieuses du cyclisme professionnel : le Tour de France, le Tour d'Italie ( Giro d'Italia ) et le Tour d'Espagne ( Vuelta a España ).
Collectivement, ils sont nommés les grands tours et ils utilisent un format similaire, une course disputée sur trois semaines avec des étapes quotidiennes. Ils ont un statut spécial dans les règlements de l'Union cycliste internationale (UCI) : plus de points UCI World Tour sont distribués dans les grands tours que sur les autres courses. Ce sont également les seules courses par étapes qui peuvent durer plus de 14 jours.
Le Tour de France est la plus ancienne et la plus prestigieuse des trois et aussi la plus célèbre course cycliste du monde. Le Tour d'Italie est la deuxième plus importante.
