The nltk module is running with other libraries in the corpus folder.
My Code
I've already tried putting 'import nltk' at first but it is still the same, and also I've tried 'from nltk.tokenize import 'PunktSentenceTokenizer'. I don't know why the Python shell can't find the definition of the nltk. How should I address this? I am still learning how to write and code python.

You misspelled the name of the package in your file, you have used ntlk instead of nltk
change
tagged = ntlk.pos_tag(words)
to
tagged = nltk.pos_tag(words)
