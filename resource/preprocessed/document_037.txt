@Piistasyo you should never use from numpy import *, starred imports are considered bad

As @aydow says, "change from numpy import * to import numpy as np":
import numpy as np
...
Or don't write np:
from numpy import *
x = random.randint(low=10, high=30, size=6)
...
Because, from numpy import *, Import every function in numpy, so np is not a function of numpy, so have to Import numpy like import numpy as np, Or, Remove np part of np.random.randint(low=10, high=30, size=6), and make it like this: random.randint(low=10, high=30, size=6), it's all since random is a function of numpy, basically that's all, to explain

You haven't defined np.
The first thing you're currently doing is
from numpy import *
This imports the package numpy, and everything inside of that package. However, numpy does not contain a module called np. The typical practice for numpy is to instead do
import numpy as np
This imports just the package numpy, and renames it to np so that you can dereference it by using the dot operator on np. This allows you to call np.random(), since random is a member of numpy, which is aliased to np.
With what you're currently doing, you could do either numpy.random() or just random (since it was part of the * that you imported from numpy).
