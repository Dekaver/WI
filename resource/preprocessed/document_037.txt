Tell us what’s happening:
I can’t seem to get this part right.
My results end up being 0 percent.
Percentage with higher education that earn >50K: 0.0%
Percentage without higher education that earn >50K: 0.0%

higher_education_rich = round(len(higher_education[higher_education['salary'] == '>50k']) / len(higher_education) * 100, 1)
lower_education_rich = round(len(lower_education[lower_education['salary'] == '>50k']) / len(lower_education) * 100, 1)
the ‘>50k’, the K needs to be capital.
