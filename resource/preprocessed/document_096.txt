attributeerror: 'dict' object has no attribute 'add'

Problem:Hello! I am a new programmer and I recently learned the concept of container types in Python. I have never worked with dictionaries and lists before. I tried running the following program in which I am adding the items into a dictionary through a list:lst = [1,2,3,4]
dct = {}
for i in lst:
dct.add(i)
print(dct)When I run this program, it generates the following errors:Traceback (most recent call last):
File "main.py", line 6, in <module>
dct.add(i)
AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'add'I tried adding the items in a set using the add() function but I am unable to understand why it is showing an error with the dictionary. Could someone please help me sort this error out?

Solution:You cannot add the items in a dictionary like this. The dictionary has a key and a value associated to that key. Moreover, the add() function is valid for the sets only. Sets and dictionaries are two different concepts. The syntax for initializing a dictionary in Python is as follows:dictionary_name = { key : value}If you want to assign the values of the list to the dictionary, you can do that as follows:lst = [1,2,3,4]
dct = {};
dct["list"] = []
dct["list"].append(lst)
print(dct)In the above program, A list is declared in the first line.In the second line, an empty dictionary is declared.I have created a key named “list” in the third line and assigned nothing to it.In the next line, I have appended the dictionary with the list, I declared earlier.In the last line, I have printed the dictionary.
