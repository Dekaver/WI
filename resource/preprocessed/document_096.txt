Answer:For Laravel >=6composer require laravel/ui
php artisan ui vue --auth
php artisan migrate
it looks you are not using Laravel 5.2, these are the available make commands in L5.2 and you are missing more than just the make:auth command
make:auth
Scaffold basic login and registration views and routes
make:console
Create a new Artisan command
make:controller
Create a new controller class
make:entity
Create a new entity.
make:event
Create a new event class
make:job
Create a new job class
make:listener
Create a new event listener class
make:middleware
Create a new middleware class
make:migration
Create a new migration file
make:model
Create a new Eloquent model class
make:policy
Create a new policy class
make:presenter
Create a new presenter.
make:provider
Create a new service provider class
make:repository
Create a new repository.
make:request
Create a new form request class
make:seeder
Create a new seeder class
make:test
Create a new test class
make:transformer
Create a new transformer.
Be sure you have this dependency in your composer.json file
"laravel/framework": "5.2.*",
Then run
composer update
