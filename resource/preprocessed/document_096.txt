The Java Development Kit (JDK), the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) form a trio of Java platform components for developing and running Java apps.
A runtime environment is a piece of software that is designed to run other software. As the runtime environment for Java, the JRE contains the Java class libraries, the Java class loader, and the JVM.
So if you don’t have JRE installed or you have an older version of the software you might encounter one of the following messages:
Error: Could not find Java SE Runtime Environment – you don’t have the Java SE version installed on your systemThis application needs version 1.x or higher of the Java Runtime Environment – you should update your Java version to the latest you can find on the official websiteA Java Runtime Environment(JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) must be available to run this app – like the first error, check if you have installed JRE or JDK and if not, install them
