I get an error message when I try FreqDist() in NLTK — NameError: name 'nltk' is not defined

I'm learning about the NLTK and my mac
is working fine except I have trouble with the FreqDist(). (I saw another question about FreqDist() but he was getting a different error message. TypeError: unhashable type: 'list')
Here's an example:
>>> from nltk.corpus import brown
>>> news_text = brown.words(categories='news')
>>> fdist = nltk.FreqDist([w.lower() for w in news_text])
Traceback (most recent call last):
`
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>`
`NameError: name 'nltk' is not defined`
This error message is pretty consistent. I get this message every time I try the FreqDist(). Other commands like - >>> brown.fileids() are fine.
Thanks for your help!

Before you can use FreqDist, you need to import it.
Add a line as follows:
import nltk
or if you just want to use FreqDist you should try this:
>>> from nltk.corpus import brown
>>> from nltk import FreqDist
>>> news_text = brown.words(categories='news')
>>> fdist = FreqDist([w.lower() for w in news_text])

or if you want to save yourself some typing in the long term, do "from nltk import FreqDist". That will allow you to write "FreqDist" in place of "nltk.FreqDist".

which means you haven't installed nltk.
follow these steps to install nltk:
1:go to this link https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools at the end of page you find setuptools-7.0.zip (md5) download it, then unzip it. you can find easy_install.py python script.
2:use the command sudo easy_install pip. By this time pip will be installed ready to use, (make sure you are in the directory where you can find easy_install script file).
3:use this command sudo pip install -U nltk. successful execution ensure that nltk is now installed.
4:open the IDLE then you type the following:
import nltk
if nltk is installed properly then you will be returned with console.

setuptools are required for older versions of Python. There is no need for the same if you are running 3.2+
You can easily download the same from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nltk
For more information on http://www.nltk.org/install.html

nltk requires data you need to download first.
Then run the following code:
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
stopwords.words("english")
