I am using below line in a loop in my code
importer = exporterslist.pop(0)
If exporterslist has no entries or it is null, it returns error: IndexError: pop from empty list. How can I bypass exporterslist with no entries in it?
One idea I can think of is if exporterslist is not null then importer = exporterslist.pop(0)
else get the next entry in the loop.
If the idea is correct, how to code it in python?

What do you mean by "get the next entry in the loop"?

You're on the right track.
if exporterslist: #if empty_list will evaluate as false.
importer = exporterslist.pop(0)
else:
#Get next entry? Do something else?

nope! You don't need the else clause, you don't have to use it.

You can also use a try/except
try:
importer = exporterslist.pop(0)
except IndexError as e:
print(e)
If you are always popping from the front you may find a deque a better option as deque.popleft() is
0(1).

This one..
exporterslist.pop(0) if exporterslist else False
..is somewhat the same as the accepted answer of @nightshadequeen's just shorter:
>>> exporterslist = []
>>> exporterslist.pop(0) if exporterslist else False
False
or maybe you could use this to get no return at all:
exporterslist.pop(0) if exporterslist else None
>>> exporterslist = []
>>> exporterslist.pop(0) if exporterslist else None
>>>

You can also .pop() only if the list has items in it by determining if the length of the list is 1 or more:
if len(exporterslist) > 1:
importer = exporterslist.pop()
