Probably you created a numpy array named time somewhere before this code snippet. You should not do that, because the module time now gets overwritten. Rename your array (to something like time_list), and it works.

for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
for file in files:
floc = file
im = Image.open(str(directory) + '\\' + floc)
pix = np.array(im.getdata())
pixels.append(pix)
labels.append(1)
# append(i)???
So far ok. But you want to leave pixels as a list until you are done with the iteration.
pixels = np.array(pixels)
labels = np.array(labels)
You had this indention right in your other question.

Iterating, collecting values in a list, and then at the end joining things into a bigger array is the right way.
To make things clear I often prefer to use notation like:
alist = []
for ..
alist.append(...)
arr = np.array(alist)
If names indicate something about the nature of the object I'm less likely to get errors like yours.
I don't understand what you are trying to do with traindata.
I doubt if you need to build it during the loop.
pixels and labels have the basic information.
traindata = np.array([traindata[i][i],traindata[1]], dtype=object)
comes from the previous question.
I'm not sure you understand that answer.
traindata = []
traindata.append(pixels)
traindata.append(labels)
if done outside the loop is just
traindata = [pixels, labels]
labels is a 1d array, a bunch of 1s (or [0,1,2,3...] if my guess is right).
pixels is a higher dimension array.
What is its shape?
Stop right there.
There's no point in turning that list into an array.
You can save the list with pickle.
You are copying code from an earlier question, and getting the formatting wrong.

It takes a dict as the second argument not an array:
I am not overly familiar but I imagine you pass the name as the key and the array as the value, something like:
sio.savemat('final.mat',{"foo":temp})
Thanks! Do we have to convert arrays to dictionaries in order to save them as .mat file?
@A.M., as far as I can tell you pass a string as the key and the array as the value. There are other keywords that affect how the array is stored

Although numpy.ndarray has a mean, max, std etc. method, it does not have a median method. For a list of all methods available for an ndarray, see the numpy documentation for ndarray.
It is available as a function that takes the array as an argument:
>>> import numpy as np
>>> a = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])
>>> np.median(a)
5.5
As you will see in the documentation for ndarray.mean, ndarray.mean and np.mean are "equivalent functions," so this is just a matter of semantics.

If len(X) is >1, axes will be a 2D array of AxesSubplot instances. So when you loop over axes, you actually get a slice along one dimension of the axes array.
axes.flat
for ax,_x in zip(axes.flat,X):
Also if you are trying to plot all these on one figure, you don't need to call plt.subplots twice, as that will create two figures.
axes
yy = func(*X)
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, len(X))
for i,_x in enumerate(X):
axes[0, i].plot(_x, y, 'b.')
axes[0, i].plot(_x, yy, 'r.')
axes[1, i].plot(_x, yy/y-1, 'r.')

append
roi_pixels = np.append(roi_pixels, c_roi_pixels)
Note that the append function creates and returns a copy! It does not modify the original.
So the problem is due to the fact that I specify a zero matrix?
No. The problem is that append is not a method of the ndarray class.

Numpy arrays do not have an append method. Use the Numpy append function instead:
import numpy as np
array_3 = np.append(array_1, array_2, axis=n)
# you can either specify an integer axis value n or remove the keyword argument completely
For example, if array_1 and array_2 have the following values:
array_1 = np.array([1, 2])
array_2 = np.array([3, 4])
If you call np.append without specifying an axis value, like so:
array([1, 2, 3, 4])
Else, if you call np.append with an axis value of 0, like so:
array_3 = np.append(array_1, array_2, axis=0)
array_3 will have the following value:
array([[1, 2],
[3, 4]])
He could also avoid converting the lists to arrays during the loop (i.e. move pixels = np.array(pixels) to end of loop)
Don't use np.append, especially not in a loop.
It is inefficient.

Check the shape of mealarray.
If the argument to fit_transform is an array of strings, it must be a one-dimensional array. (That is, mealarray.shape must be of the form (n,).)
For example, you'll get the "no attribute" error if mealarray has a shape such as (n, 1).
data = vectorizer.fit_transform(mealarray.ravel())
I tried it with ravel and got the following error. AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'.
The shape of mealarray is (5000,1) because I created it using "mealarray = np.empty((plen,1), dtype=object)"
OK, so you then populate the array afterwards.
Then you must have a count of the actual number of words in mealarray, correct?
Let's say it is nwords.
Then pass mealarray[:nwords].ravel() to fit_transform().
(Although I wonder why you create the array with shape (plen,1) instead of just (plen,).)
Note: In my previous comment, I assume that you fill mealarray from the beginning, with no indices containing None between indices containing words.

In Python2.7 adding a print('alpha',alpha) at the start of the loop produces:
('alpha', 0.5235987755982988)
('alpha', array([ 1.85083849,
2.29325173]))
('alpha', array([[array([ 1.98227296,
1.95343536]), 1.7138098231972174],
[array([ 1.81303794,
1.7604074 ]), 2.2932517265367176]], dtype=object))
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "stack32444132.py", line 17, in <module>
g1 = L1 * np.cos(theta) + L2 * np.cos(alpha) - L3
AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'cos'
So the error is caused by calling np.cos(alpha) where alpha is an object array.
alpha is (2,2); the 1st column contains length 2 arrays; the 2nd contains floats.
So at some point in the loop you are appending or conconatenating arrays or lists of different length.
s = np.array([[alpha], [L3]]) - J/np.array([[g1], [g2]])
alpha = s[0]
('J', (2, 2), dtype('float64'))
('alpha', 0.5235987755982988)
('L3', 1.5)
....
('J', (2, 2), dtype('O'))
('alpha', array([ 1.85083849,
2.29325173]))
('L3', array([-10.61649234,
1.5
]))
In the 2nd loop J changes from a 2x2 matrix of floats to a 2x2 of objects.
Python3 raises an error earlier, at the first encounter of the epsilon = max(epsilon_alpha.all, epsilon_L3.all) expression.
epsilon_alpha.all is a method; epsilon_alpha.all() is a boolean.
But even that produces an error when epsilon_alpha becomes an array.
OK, this loop runs (alpha remains a scalar); it doesn't stop, presumably because epsilon does not get small enough; but I'll leave that to you.
while epsilon > 0.0001:
# print('alpha', alpha)
g1 = L1 * np.cos(theta) + L2 * np.cos(alpha) - L3
dg1dalpha = -L2 * np.sin(alpha)
dg1dL3 = -1;
g2 = L1 * np.sin(theta) - L2 * np.sin(alpha)
dg2dalpha = -L2 * np.cos(alpha);
dg2dL3 = 0
J = np.array([[dg1dalpha, dg1dL3], [dg2dalpha, dg2dL3]])
print('J', J.shape,J.dtype)
# (2,2) floats
s = np.array([[alpha], [L3]]) - J/np.array([[g1], [g2]])
s = s[:,0]
# fudge to turn (2,2) array into a (2,) array
epsilon_alpha = abs(s[0] - alpha)
epsilon_L3 = abs(s[1] - L3)
epsilon = max(epsilon_alpha, epsilon_L3)
# max on 2 scalars is ok
alpha = s[0] # scalar
L3 = s[1]
# scalar
n = n + 1
The root of the problem is in the
s = np.array([[alpha], [L3]]) - J/np.array([[g1], [g2]])
If alpha and L3 are scalars, then np.array([[alpha], [L3]]) is (2,1).
So is np.array([[g1], [g2]]).
But since J is (2,2), s is also (2,2).
But you've been using s[0] and s[1], evidently assuming s is `(2,).
s = s[:,0]
makes s a (2,) so the rest of the code works.
Since epsilon does not converge it probably is the wrong fix.
May I stress - when developing numpy code, pay close attention to the array shapes.
If the shapes are wrong you'll get errors like this.
In my experience getting the shapes right is 80% of the debugging work.
Wow, @hpaulj thanks for the detailed post. I need to learn how to do efficient debugging like you just did. I'll keep working on getting the shapes right as you suggested.

Check the Pandas documentation, but I think
X_train =df_train.drop(['ID','TARGET'], axis=1).values
.values returns a numpy array, not a Pandas dataframe.
An array does not have a columns attribute.
remove_features_identical - if you pass this an array, make sure you are only using array, not dataframe, features.
Otherwise, make sure you pass it a dataframe.
And don't use variable names like DataFrame.

append on an ndarray is ambiguous; to which axis do you want to append the data? Without knowing precisely what your data looks like, I can only provide an example using numpy.concatenate that I hope will help:
