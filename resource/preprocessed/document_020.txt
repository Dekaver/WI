AttributeError using scipy.sparse.toarray()

1 Answer 1
sp.hstack (i.e. numpy.hstack) is the ordinary, dense hstack, which won't combine the sparse arrays correctly. It builds a 1D numpy array already (of object dtype; in other words, it just wraps the Python-level objects and crams them in there.) You want scipy.sparse.hstack:sp.hstacknumpy.hstackscipy.sparse.hstackIn [332]: sp.hstack([a, b])Out[332]: array([<4x5 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.int64'>' with 17 stored elements in COOrdinate format>, <4x2 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.int64'>' with 7 stored elements in COOrdinate format>], dtype=object)In [333]: sp.hstack([a, b]).toarray()---------------------------------------------------------------------------AttributeError Traceback (most recent call last)<ipython-input-333-4f469eb98b12> in <module>()----> 1 sp.hstack([a, b]).toarray()AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'toarray'In [334]: sp.sparse.hstack([a, b])Out[334]: <4x7 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.int64'>' with 24 stored elements in COOrdinate format>In [335]: sp.sparse.hstack([a, b]).toarray()Out[335]: array([[3, 2, 7, 0, 5, 5, 1], [7, 1, 2, 1, 7, 0, 8], [6, 1, 6, 1, 8, 6, 2], [7, 6, 0, 5, 0, 8, 8]], dtype=int64)

Can't bind to 'dataSource' since it isn't a known property of 'table' even when modules are imported

Can't bind to 'dataSource' since it isn't a known property of 'table' even when modules are imported
I am implementing a mat-table ui. In my app.module I imported my material.module like so: import MaterialModule from './material-design/material.module'; imports: [
MaterialModule,
],
In my component that implements this, I have this code: import Component, OnInit, ViewChild from '@angular/core'; import MatTableDataSource, MatSort, MatPaginator from '@angular/material'; displayedColumns: string = ['PlateNumber', 'Purpose', 'Schedule', 'Select']; dataSource: MatTableDataSource<ScheduledVehicleModel>; @ViewChild(MatPaginator) paginator: MatPaginator; @ViewChild(MatSort) sort: MatSort; getScheduledVhicles()
this.vs.getScheduledVhicles()
.subscribe((data: any) =>
this.dataSource = new MatTableDataSource(data);
this.dataSource.paginator = this.paginator;
this.data

Get week number in month from date in PHP?

Get week number in month from date in PHP?
I have an array of random dates (not coming from MySQL). I need to group them by the week as Week1, Week2, and so on upto Week5.
What I have is this: $dates = array('2015-09-01','2015-09-05','2015-09-06','2015-09-15','2015-09-17');
What I need is a function to get the week number of the month by providing the date.
I know that I can get the weeknumber by doing
date('W',strtotime('2015-09-01'));
but this week number is the number between year (1-52) but I need the week number of the month only, e.g. in Sep 2015 there are 5 weeks: date('W',strtotime('2015-09-01'));
I should be able to get the week Week1 by just providing the date e.g. $weekNumber = getWeekNumber('2015-09-01') //output 1; $weekNumber = getWeekNumber('2015-09-17') //output 3;
Please clarify your question.

TS2339: Property 'includes' does not exist on type 'string'

TS2339: Property 'includes' does not exist on type 'string'
I have seen this error mentioned in regards to string arrays but not actual strings. I have a TypeScript file with the line if (!bus.lineInfo.PublishedLineName.includes(input)) {
This gives me an error of TS2339: Property 'includes' does not exist on type 'string'.
bus
is a variable that implements the bus
interface: bus bus interface bus
"lineInfo": string // false if this is "FFFFFF", otherwise it's the color
,
"warnings": boolean
lineInfo.PublishedLineName
is declared as a string , and String.prototype.includes()
is a function according to MDN, so why does the TypeScript compiler complain about the missing property/method? lineInfo.PublishedLineName string String.prototype.includes()
What is includes or what do you think it is?
