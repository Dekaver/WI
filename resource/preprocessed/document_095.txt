I am trying to get rgb values for specific pixels "interest points"
JavaCopy Code
for (int i = 0; i <=locations_original.size();i++)
{
System.out.println("x,y: " + locations_original.get(i).x + ", " +
locations_original.get(i).y);
Double x=locations_original.get(i).x;
Double y=locations_original.get(i).y;
int pixel = image.getRGB(x.intValue(),y.intValue());
printPixelARGB(pixel);
}
JavaCopy Code
public static void printPixelARGB(int pixel) {
int alpha = (pixel >> 24) & 0xff;
int red = (pixel >> 16) & 0xff;
int green = (pixel >> 8) & 0xff;
int blue = (pixel) & 0xff;
System.out.println("argb: " + alpha + ", " + red + ", " + green + ",
" + blue);
}
but there is an error in this line
JavaCopy Code
System.out.println("x,y: " + locations_original.get(i).x + ", " +locations_original.get(i).y);
Quote:as following

How can I fix this?

Most likely, the line
JavaCopy Code
for (int i = 0; i <= locations_original.size(); i++)
should be replaced with
JavaCopy Code
for (int i = 0; i < locations_original.size(); i++)
Do I even have to explain why? This is elementary mathematics; and most developers catch this bug from the first glance, at the level of reflexes, because right code is a very common pattern: a range of N elements is indexed from 0 to N−1.
