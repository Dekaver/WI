Answer:The error message says that the dictionaries in Python do not provide an append operation. You can instead just assign new values to their respective keys in a dictionary mydict = {}
mydict['item'] = input_valueIf you just want to append values as they're entered you could instead use a list.mylist = []
mylist.append(input_value)Hope this will help you to fix your problem.

Solution:As the error message point out, dictionaries in Python do not given an append operation.You can instead only employ new values to their respective keys in a dictionary.mydict = {}
mydict['item'] = input_valueIn case you're wanting to append values as they're entered you could instead employ a list.mylist = []
mylist.append(input_value)Your line user['areas'].append[temp] seems like it is trying to access a dictionary at the value of key 'areas', in ncase you instead employ a list you must be able to perform an append operation.Employing a list instead:user['areas'] = []On that note, you might want to inspect out the probability of employing a defaultdict(list) for your issue. Either employ dict.setdefault() in case the key is not included yet to dictionary :dict.setdefault(key,[]).append(value)or use, in case you meanwhile have the keys set up:dict[key].append(value)You have done everything right apart from where you have setresults = {} You were inferred to perform a list([ ]), however instead you have done a dictionary({ }). They are actually confusing, however your code must be:def get_class_average(students):
results = []
for student in students:
results.append(get_average(student))
return average(results)
