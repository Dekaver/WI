So I have to create a program where I use polymorphism and inheritance to create arrows that point left and arrow and I did that. however, when I created my main class and try to invoke the methods, say for example "LeftArrow.drawHere" to draw the arrow i get errors saying I cannot make a static reference to the non static field "drawHere() from the class LeftArrow". I was wondering then if I can't do that how can I design my main method so it draws the arrows?
here is my code, note that there are several classes but I will post all of them here.
import java.util.Scanner;
public class LeftArrow extends ShapeBasic
{
private int tail, width;
private static int inside;
public LeftArrow()
{
super();
tail = 0;
width = 0;
}
public LeftArrow(int noff, int ntail, int nwidth)
{
super(noff);
tail = ntail;
setWidth(nwidth);
}
public void setTail(int ntail)
{
tail = ntail;
}
public int getTail()
{
return tail;
}
public void setWidth(int nwidth)
{
if (nwidth % 2 == 1)
{
width = nwidth;
}
else
{
System.out.println(" Width must be odd");
System.out.println("Enter a new width");
Scanner key = new Scanner(System.in);
int wid = key.nextInt();
setWidth(wid);
}
}
public int getWidth()
{
return width;
}
public void drawHere()
{
drawTriangle();
drawTail();
drawBTriangle();
//System.out.println();
}
public void drawTriangle()
{
inside = 1;
int split = (width/2);
skipSpaces(getOffset());
System.out.println('*');
for(int count = 0; count < split; count ++)
{
skipSpaces(getOffset() - (inside + 1));
System.out.print('*');
skipSpaces(inside);
System.out.print('*');
inside = inside + 2;
System.out.println();
}
}
public void drawTail()
{
skipSpaces(getOffset() - getInside() - 1);
System.out.print('*');
skipSpaces(getInside());
for (int count = 0; count < tail ; count++)
{
System.out.print('*');
}
}
public void drawBTriangle()
{
int inside = getInside();
int split = (width/2);
System.out.println();
for(int count = 0; count < split; count ++)
{
skipSpaces(getOffset() - (inside - 1));
System.out.print('*');
inside = inside - 2;
skipSpaces(inside);
System.out.print('*');
System.out.println();
}
skipSpaces(getOffset());
System.out.print('*');
}
public int getInside()
{
return inside;
}
private static void skipSpaces(int number)
{
for (int count = 0; count < number; count++)
System.out.print(' ');
}
@Override
public void setOffset(int noff) {
// TODO Auto-generated method stub
}
@Override
public int getOffset() {
// TODO Auto-generated method stub
return 0;
}

I'd ask to see your main method, but I don't have the reputation.
At a guess, I'd say maybe you are not actually instantiating objects of these classes in your main method, but trying to call the methods from them. If, for instance, you do this:
LeftArrow lArrow = new LeftArrow();
lArrow.drawHere();
it should work.

The method drawHere is declared as non-static. Instead of LeftArrow.drawHere() you should call
LeftArrow left = new LefArrow(a, b, c);
left.drawHere();

main is static. It needs to create instances of LeftArrow before it can use them. Something like this:
LeftArrow myArrow = new LeftArrow();
myArrow.drawHere();
