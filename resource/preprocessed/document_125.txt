Incoparable Java Types boolean and object

I have this piece of code which worked in Java 6
if(false==sess.getAttribute("admin") || null==sess.getAttribute("admin"))
{
res.sendRedirect("/myapp/login.jsp?errmsg=You must log in as an administrator to manage resources");
return;
}
I want to familiarize myself with the new features of Java 7 and what it offers new in javaee hence I upgraded netbeans to 7.4 and jdk 7u45.
My project opened successfully however the file with this code is marked as a java class with an error by netbeans. Running the project I get the error
java.lang.RuntimeException: Uncompilable source code - incomparable types: boolean and java.lang.Object
What I want to ask is why this worked in java6 and doesn't work in java7
FYI HttpSession sess = req.getSession();

I don't believe the code compiled successfully in java 6.

It did. That is why I am asking.

I want you to take that java file and compile it individually with java 6.
Then post the contents of the file and the output of javac.

HttpSession.getAttribute returns an Object.
Change the line to (Boolean.FALSE==sess.getAtrribute)
Looks like autoboxing (boolean to Boolean) has changed in Java.
Unfortunately I cannot reproduce your error. I have seen a similar error message in the same Netbeans 7.4/jdk 7u45.
My code:
if (true == evt.getNewValue())
(where evt is a PropertyChangeEvent)
The message in Netbeans (when I hover over the red cross left to the statement) says "incomparable types: boolean and Object". Notice the difference with your message: the missing "java/lang" before Object.
And even stranger: my code compiles without any problem.
Compiler options in Netbeans are: "-version -Xlint:unchecked -Xlint:deprecation"

You should try with
if(false==(Boolean)sess.getAttribute("admin") || null==sess.getAttribute("admin"))
{
res.sendRedirect("/myapp/login.jsp?errmsg=You must log in as an administrator to
manage resources");
return;
}

getAttribute probably returns either an Object or a boolean. If it returns a boolean, then null==getAttrubute will not work and if it returns an Object then false==getAttribute will fail.

True. But this does not explain why it worked perfectly in java6 and not working in java7
