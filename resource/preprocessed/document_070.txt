So, I keep getting the error "TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable"
Apparently it's from the two lines I've marked.
Code: Select all### THIS NEXT LINE CAUSES ERRORS ###
$ generate_random_cards(3, "a", "i", "u")
init python:
def generate_random_cards(number_of_cards, card1, card2, card3): #card1="None", card2="None", card3="None", card4="None", card5="None", card6="None", card7="None", card8="None", card9="None", card10="None"):
assigned_card_value_0 = False # "None"
### THIS NEXT LINE CAUSES ERRORS ###
for [i] in number_of_cards:
assigned_card_value_[i] = False #"None"
for [i] in number_of_cards:
temp_random_number = 0
#while assigned_card_value_[temp_random_number] == "None":
while not assigned_card_value_[temp_random_number]:
temp_random_number = renpy.random.randint(1, number_of_cards)
if not assigned_card_value_[temp_random_number]: # == "None":
assigned_card_value_[temp_random_number] = card[i]
#global assigned_card_value_[temp_random_number]
return

The #renpy IRC channel is a great place to chat with other devs. Due to the nature of IRC and timezone differences, people probably won't reply right away.
If you'd like to view or use any code from my VN PM me. All code is freely available without restriction, but also without warranty or (much) support.

You need the range function for that.
Code: Select allfor i in range(number_of_cards):
Though it looks like you're going for a way overcomplicated approach.
What's the purpose of this function?

I will have a group of 3-10 flashcards with Hiragana written on them.
There will be one more flashcard with Romaji written on it.
The player must drag the matching Hiragana flashcard on top of the Romaji flashcard.
I wanted to make a function that will be easy to reuse, and will randomize the cards.

Note that the following might be of interest:
Code: Select all
$foo = range(10)
"Unshuffled [foo]"
$renpy.random.shuffle(foo)
"Shuffled [foo]"
