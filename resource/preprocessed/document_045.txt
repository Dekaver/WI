When running this notebook on my python 3.7 environment, I encountered the following error
---> 14 wine = pandas.read_sql(sql,hdbi) .. NameError: name 'pandas' is not defined
Changing the relevant lines like below, it worked fine.
#wine = pandas.read_sql(sql,hdbi) wine = pd.read_sql(sql,hdbi)
I guess that is because we declared in the start of code
import pandas as pd
Posting this just in case we need to change it.

You're welcome to submit a PR to propose that change yourself, otherwise I'll try to get that corrected later today or tomorrow.
