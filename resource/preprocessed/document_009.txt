I am trying on two machines:
Cluster with GTX 1080 Ti (This issue is solved when i did pip3 install pandas==0.23.0) which throws out [the other error]
Local PC with GTX 1080 Ti (This issue still exist even after the pip as above)

Okay I think I cannot help with this error as I am not able to re-produce it.
I will check out the other error ASAP.
I guess the problem on your local machine has something to do with your python environment.

It worked fine when the panda version was upgraded to 0.25.1 and the following change was done in utils.py:
if 'acc' in row_best_model.index:
df_best_model['best_model_train_acc'] = row_best_model['acc']
else:
df_best_model['best_model_train_acc'] = 0

same issue here.
I fixed it by changing two lines of code:
df_best_model['best_model_train_acc'] = row_best_model['accuracy']
if plot_test_acc:
df_best_model['best_model_val_acc'] = row_best_model['val_accuracy']
I guess this problem is due to the version of pandas or something because I did not install all the lib in requirements.txt. You can print row_best_model to check it out.
Hope it helps.
