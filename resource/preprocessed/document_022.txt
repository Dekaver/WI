Your problem is that you're not adding data as a query parameter, indicated by adding a ? after /search
Here is your code modified and working
import urllib.request
import urllib.parse
headers = {}
headers['User-Agent'] = "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686)"
values = {'q': 'python programming tutorials'}
data = urllib.parse.urlencode(values)
url = 'https://www.google.com/search?'+data
req = urllib.request.Request(url, headers = headers)
resp = urllib.request.urlopen(req)
resp_data = resp.read()
print(resp_data)
The actual difference being your url
>>> url
'https://www.google.com/searchq=python+programming+tutorials'
and my modified url
>>> url
'https://www.google.com/search?q=python+programming+tutorials'
There is no resource located at https://www.google.com/searchq and that is the reason you're getting
urllib.error.HTTPError: HTTP Error 404: Not Found
