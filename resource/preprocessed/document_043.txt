I'm getting a few errors here but I think it's due to pandas not importing as it's greyed out. If that is the problem, how would I fix this?

You have imported it as
import pandas as pd
and calling
#pandas
df = pandas.DataFrame(columns = ['Date','Unix','Ticker','DE Ratio'])
You could either change
import pandas as pd to import pandas or
df = pandas.DataFrame(columns = ['Date','Unix','Ticker','DE Ratio']) to df = pd.DataFrame(columns = ['Date','Unix','Ticker','DE Ratio']).
edit:
error is due to missing )
save = gather.replace(' ','').replace(')','').replace('(','').replace('/',''+('.csv'))

Hi, Thanks! I'm really new to python (and coding outsite of HTML) so appreciate the example.
I made the "pd.DataFrame"
and I'm not getting the below error. Which I confusing because I thought I set the save function above.
C:\Anaconda\python.exe C:/Users/nickd/Documents/SKLEARN-STOCKS/stock-mach.py
File "C:/Users/nickd/Documents/SKLEARN-STOCKS/stock-mach.py", line 36
print(save)
^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax
Process finished with exit code 1

You imported pandas as pd. Either refer to it as such throughout, or remove the as pd from the import.
(Plus, never ever ever do except Exception... pass. You'll swallow all sorts of errors and never know what they were. If you aren't going to handle them, don't catch them at all.)
