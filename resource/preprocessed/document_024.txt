I found that in your example code, the weight of the beamformer is not consistent with the definition. for example:
But in the definition Ôºö
And then, I want to use the method you defined to find the weight, there are some errors, I tried a lot of ways to solve it, but all failed.
If I define some of the parameters in the weights as you would in the sample code. Then the code will not report an error, but the voice after beamforming has no sound.
I don't know what the reason for doing this is? Can you explain it to me in your spare time?

One more tip üòÑ : you can use code block formatting to enhance readability. I have updated your reply above in this way.
Now, I have tried to run the above code sample and it doesn't produce the same error for me. I see above that you are using a notebook. Notebooks are well-known for their hidden state (because of splitting the code in cells run in arbitrary order), so maybe that was the cause ? You could try to paste all this into a script and run it from the command line. Here is the slightly modified code that produces the expected output from the example.
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.io import wavfile
from scipy.signal import fftconvolve
import IPython
import pyroomacoustics as pra
# specify signal and noise source
# >> Modified to use samples available in pyroomacoustics examples
fs, signal = wavfile.read("examples/input_samples/cmu_arctic_us_aew_a0001.wav")
fs, noise = wavfile.read("examples/input_samples/doing_the_dishes.wav")
# Create 6x6 shoebox room with source and interferer and simulate
Lg_t = 0.100
# filter size in seconds
Lg = np.ceil(Lg_t*fs)
# in samples
room_bf = pra.ShoeBox([6,6], fs=fs, max_order=12)
source = np.array([3, 1])
interferer = np.array([3, 5])
room_bf.add_source(source, delay=0., signal=signal)
room_bf.add_source(interferer, delay=0., signal=noise[:len(signal)])
# Create geometry equivalent to Amazon Echo
center = [3, 3]; radius =0.027
fft_len = 512; M = 4;
echo = pra.circular_2D_array(center=center, M=4, phi0=0, radius=radius)
echo = np.concatenate((echo, np.array(center, ndmin=2).T), axis=1)
mics = pra.Beamformer(echo, room_bf.fs, N=fft_len, Lg=Lg)
room_bf.add_microphone_array(mics)
R_n = (M * Lg)*(M * Lg)
# Compute
weights
# >> This function also requires the R_n parameter when there is only one source
mics.rake_max_sinr_weights(room_bf.sources[0][:1], R_n=np.eye(mics.M))
room_bf.compute_rir()
room_bf.simulate()
# plot the room and resulting beamformer before simulation
fig, ax = room_bf.plot(freq=[500, 1000, 2000, 4000], img_order=0)
ax.legend(['500', '1000', '2000', '4000'])
# >> I was getting an empty figure and had to get rid of the line below
# fig.set_size_inches(20, 8)
plt.show()
useful!
