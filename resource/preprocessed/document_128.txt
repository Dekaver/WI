Java Program - “Erroneous tree type” Issue

I have been going thorough some practice problems and have a question on this code. I was able to figure it out using a different method, but I don't understand why this example doesn't work.The code asks for input until the user enters the same input twice, where it should then display the duplicate input before ending the program.
I am getting:
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Uncompilable source code - Erroneous tree type: any>
Error on the last line with the word variable. Any ideas?
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class MoreThanOnce {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
// create here the ArrayList
ArrayList<String> words = new ArrayList<String>();
while (true){
System.out.print("Type a word: ");
String word = reader.nextLine();
if(!words.contains(word)){
words.add(word);
}else{
break;
}
}
System.out.println("You gave the word " + word + " twice");
}
}

As i copy you code i got a compiler error: "word cannot be resolved to a variable" in last line
– Jens
Aug 12 '15 at 5:34
Other than what Jens noted, I was able to run your program without any errors. I used JDK 1.7

Your code does not compile. The variable "word" you want to display at the end is not in the right scope : you declare it in the while loop but try to use it outside this loop.
Just change thing like this :
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class MoreThanOnce {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
// create here the ArrayList
String word; //variable declared before loop
ArrayList<String> words = new ArrayList<String>();
while (true){
System.out.print("Type a word: ");
word = reader.nextLine();
if(!words.contains(word)){
words.add(word);
}else{
break;
}
}
System.out.println("You gave the word " + word + " twice");
}
Hope it helps.

This doesn't seem to work either. I am getting the same error even with your changes.

Hi, its strange because it works fine for me with this change. Are your sure the change as been taken into account when you tried. What editor do you use ? What version of Java ?
– Mathias Aboudou
Aug 12 '15 at 5:51
Thanks for the responses. I got it working after saving it to a new file. I don't know what the issue was, but it is working after implementing your change. Thanks.

Another question - why do you have to declare it before the while loop? Are the variables that are declared inside the while loop local to the while loop itself - so they cant
be used anywhere outside the loop block?
– xCargot
Aug 12 '15 at 6:01
Yes exactly ! And this is true for every block (for, if, method...) you declare a variable in.

Are you using NetBeans ?
If yes then there is an open bug

Declare "String word" variable before while loop.
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class MoreThanOnce {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
// create here the ArrayList
String word;
ArrayList<String> words = new ArrayList<String>();
while (true) {
System.out.print("Type a word: ");
word = reader.nextLine();
if (!words.contains(word)) {
words.add(word);
} else {
break;
}
}
System.out.println("You gave the word " + word + " twice");
}
}
