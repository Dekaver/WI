I was trying to scrape a website for practice, but I kept on getting the HTTP Error 403 (does it think I'm a bot)?
Here is my code:
#import requests
import urllib.request
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
#from urllib import urlopen
import re
webpage = urllib.request.urlopen('http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/products/#sortField=oi&sortAsc=false&venues=3&page=1&cleared=1&group=1').read
findrows = re.compile('<tr class="- banding(?:On|Off)>(.*?)</tr>')
findlink = re.compile('<a href =">(.*)</a>')
row_array = re.findall(findrows, webpage)
links = re.finall(findlink, webpate)
print(len(row_array))
iterator = []
The error I get is:
File "C:\Python33\lib\urllib\request.py", line 160, in urlopen
return opener.open(url, data, timeout)
File "C:\Python33\lib\urllib\request.py", line 479, in open
response = meth(req, response)
File "C:\Python33\lib\urllib\request.py", line 591, in http_response
'http', request, response, code, msg, hdrs)
File "C:\Python33\lib\urllib\request.py", line 517, in error
return self._call_chain(*args)
File "C:\Python33\lib\urllib\request.py", line 451, in _call_chain
result = func(*args)
File "C:\Python33\lib\urllib\request.py", line 599, in http_error_default
raise HTTPError(req.full_url, code, msg, hdrs, fp)
urllib.error.HTTPError: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden

This is probably because of mod_security or some similar server security feature which blocks known spider/bot user agents (urllib uses something like python urllib/3.3.0, it's easily detected). Try setting a known browser user agent with:
from urllib.request import Request, urlopen
req = Request('http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/products/#sortField=oi&sortAsc=false&venues=3&page=1&cleared=1&group=1', headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'})
webpage = urlopen(req).read()
This works for me.
By the way, in your code you are missing the () after .read in the urlopen line, but I think that it's a typo.
TIP: since this is exercise, choose a different, non restrictive site. Maybe they are blocking urllib for some reason...

I assume it's safe to reuse req for multiple urlopen calls.

It might be little late, but I already have User-Agent in my code, still it gives me Error 404: Access denied

This works but I feel like they must have a good reason to block bots and I'm violating their terms of service

Definitely it's blocking because of your use of urllib based on the user agent. This same thing is happening to me with OfferUp. You can create a new class called AppURLopener which overrides the user-agent with Mozilla.
import urllib.request
class AppURLopener(urllib.request.FancyURLopener):
version = "Mozilla/5.0"
opener = AppURLopener()
response = opener.open('http://httpbin.org/user-agent')

This works just fine but I need to attach the ssl configuration to this. How do I do this? Before I just added it as a second parameter (urlopen(request,context=ctx))

looks like it did open but it says 'ValueError: read of closed file'

@zeta How did you manage to scrape OfferUp and provide the requisite geo coordinates to perform the search from a script?
– CJ Travis

@CJTravis , I wasn't scraping OfferUp. I was just retrieving item values based on an exact URL of an item. That didn't require any geo coordinates for me

"This is probably because of mod_security or some similar server security feature which blocks known
spider/bot
user agents (urllib uses something like python urllib/3.3.0, it's easily detected)" - as already mentioned by Stefano Sanfilippo
from urllib.request import Request, urlopen
url="https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=html+error+403"
req = Request(url, headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'})
web_byte = urlopen(req).read()
webpage = web_byte.decode('utf-8')
The web_byte is a byte object returned by the server and the content type present in webpage is mostly utf-8.
Therefore you need to decode web_byte using decode method.
This solves complete problem while I was having trying to scrape from a website using PyCharm
P.S -> I use python 3.4

Based on previous answers this has worked for me with Python 3.7 by increasing the timeout to 10.
from urllib.request import Request, urlopen
req = Request('Url_Link', headers={'User-Agent': 'XYZ/3.0'})
webpage = urlopen(req, timeout=10).read()
print(webpage)

Since the page works in browser and not when calling within python program, it seems that the web app that serves that url recognizes that you request the content not by the browser.
Demonstration:
curl --dump-header r.txt http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/products/#sortField=oi&sortAsc=false&venues=3&page=1&cleared=1&group=1
...
<HTML><HEAD>
<TITLE>Access Denied</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<H1>Access Denied</H1>
You don't have permission to access ...
</HTML>
and the content in r.txt has status line:
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Try posting header 'User-Agent' which fakes web client.
NOTE: The page contains Ajax call that creates the table you probably want to parse. You'll need to check the javascript logic of the page or simply using browser debugger (like Firebug / Net tab) to see which url you need to call to get the table's content.

You can try in two ways. The detail is in this link.
1) Via pip
pip install --upgrade certifi
2) If it doesn't work, try to run a Cerificates.command that comes bundled with Python 3.* for Mac:(Go to your python installation location and double click the file)
open /Applications/Python\ 3.*/Install\ Certificates.command

If you feel guilty about faking the user-agent as Mozilla (comment in the top answer from Stefano), it could work with a non-urllib User-Agent as well. This worked for the sites I reference:
req = urlrequest.Request(link, headers={'User-Agent': 'XYZ/3.0'})
urlrequest.urlopen(req, timeout=10).read()
My application is to test validity by scraping specific links that I refer to, in my articles. Not a generic scraper.
