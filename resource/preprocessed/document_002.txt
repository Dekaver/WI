This is weird because it didn't bark when you imported brown from nltk.corpus...

You need to import nltk first to use nltk.ConditionalFreqDist
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.ConditionalFreqDist()
<ConditionalFreqDist with 0 conditions>
Or use namespaces,
>>> from nltk import ConditionalFreqDist
>>> ConditionalFreqDist()
<ConditionalFreqDist with 0 conditions>

which means you haven't installed nltk. follow these steps to install nltk:
1:go to this link https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools at the end of page you find setuptools-7.0.zip (md5) download it, then unzip it. you can find easy_install.py python script.
2:use the command sudo easy_install pip. By this time pip will be installed ready to use, (make sure you are in the directory where you can find easy_install script file).
3:use this command sudo pip install -U nltk. successful execution ensure that nltk is now installed.
4:open the IDLE then you type the following:
import nltk
if nltk is installed properly then you will be returned with console.
then you can use your code without any error.

So what does your answer include that the other answer didn't? Nothing as far as I can see. You should only provide an answer if yours include a new solution to the problem. Not repeating what others have already said. I suggest you delete this answer but please don't be discouraged. Read How To Answer and try again.
