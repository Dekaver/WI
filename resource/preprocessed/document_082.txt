Smartsheet Data Tracker: AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'append'

I am new to Python and I'm working with Smartsheet Data Tracker to update a sheet from a CSV file.
I have problems about the array list management in Python; I don't know about this error, I was reading about this error on StackOverflow but I don't understand it:
The error:
"File "C:\Users\David\DataTraker\connectors\CSVCon.py", line 61, in __init__
self.csvData.append(readerRow)
AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'append'"
And my code:
def __init__(self, sourceConfig):
self.csvData = []
self.csvData = {"sourceId": "siniestros",
"connectorClassName": "CSVCon",
"fileName": "siniestros.csv",
"isStrict": False}
for readerRow in sourceReader:
self.csvData.append(readerRow)

What is going wrong is that you create a list to which you would like to append later. However you overwrite that afterwards with a dictionary, to which you cannot append. This is why you get an AttributeError.
To fix this, I would rename your dictionary (self.csvData={stuff}) that you created after your list to something else such as self.meta, perhaps. Alternatively, you could rename your list.
It doesn't matter which, you just need to remove the naming conflict so both variables can co-exist in the namespace.

Actually, this was more an issue of poorly commented code in the Data Tracker project that caused the confusion in the CSVCon.py file. The CSV Configuration settings that are in those comments are an example of what should be in the settings/sources.json file.
The Configure Source section in the project documentation provides some more detail on setting up your source in the sources.json file.
There is also a section with an explanation of the CSV source specifically.
The confusing commenting has been updated to be more clear.

My VS code interface for Jupyter notebook is very different from the new version
I recently started learning python for data analysis and decided to use VS code for its new Jupyter notebook feature. I installed the extension for python and jupyter notebook in VS code but for some reason my interface is very different from the one in the new update.
I understand this is a small issue but, It's really throwing me off. Can someone please let me know what I am doing wrong here?
Thank you

Cannot locate child element Selenium
Trying to pick out single restaurant elements under the All Restaurants category on this page. https://www.foodpanda.sg/restaurants/new?lat=1.2915902&lng=103.8379066&vertical=restaurants
All li elements have a different class name. The only working xpath, I have been able to figure out is this one.
//ul[@class="vendor-list"]//li[3]
I cannot figure out how to increase this number and get all the restaurants, which is complicated by the fact that there is an infinite scroll as well.
j = 1
def get_rest():
global j
while True:
driver.execute_script("window.scrollBy(0,2525)", "")
time.sleep(5)
var = f'{[j]}'
elems = driver.find_elements_by_xpath(f'//ul[@class="vendor-list"]//li{var})
return elems
Access Smartsheet by column Name instead of Column Id
I am a newbie working with Smartsheet, I am trying to access the values of columns and store them in a list, and I am able to access the values by the index. In my use case, people can delete random columns from the smartsheet and that can cause my index numbering affected while reading the data. For Example - My smartsheet looks like below:
Vin | Owner | Use | Location
123
abc
test
CA
456
xyz
prod
TX
The code I used so far to access the data is:
import smartsheet
from simple_smartsheet import Smartsheet
from simple_smartsheet.models import Sheet, Column, Row, Cell, ColumnType
from pprint import pprint
import pandas as pd
import re
import sasl
import json
from fastparquet import write
# from influxdb import InfluxDBClient
import thrift_sasl
import prestodb
import s3fs
import boto3
from pyhive import hive
smartsheet = smartsheet.Smartsheet('adjgdjcdjchbdclkcn')
# Get current user
#user_profile = smartsheet.Users.get_current_user()
# Get all columns.
MySheet = smartsheet.Sheets.get_sheet(1234567891234567)
Vin = []
Owner = []
Use = []
Location = []
def Data():
for RowIndex in range(0, len(MySheet.rows)):
Vin.append(MySheet.rows[RowIndex].cells[2].display_value)
Use.append(MySheet.rows[RowIndex].cells[3].display_value)
Owner.append(MySheet.rows[RowIndex].cells[4].display_value)
Location.append(MySheet.rows[RowIndex].cells[5].display_value)
print(Vin)
print(Use)
Print(Owner)
Print(Location)
Result I want is (Using the column name instead of Index):
Vin = [123, 456]
Owner = [abc, xyz]
Use = [test, prod]
Location = [CA, TX]
Now Instead of accessing the values by index, how can I append the values in a list using column name instead? Any help or lead is much appreciated. Thank You in advance!
Get hyperlink to sheet based on SheetID
I am importing a Smartsheet Report through Python, using an API. One of the columns in this report contains a hyperlink that works in Smartsheet, however when importing the report with Python I only receive the words of this column, and not the link behind them. Is it possible to get the URLs of the sheets that these hyperlinks are referring to in any other way? I was thinking maybe based on SheetID (which I can find using the title of the indepentent sheets), but all other suggestions are very welcome!
Call Web Service when contents change
We'd like to allow our users to make changes to our ERP (only very limited conditions) from within the smartsheet.
Is there a way to add a web service call based on changes to a cell?
