Problem:I was doing a project work where I had to use pandas and numpy. I wrote a python program with them:data =pandas.read_csv('valla',nov=',')
data=data.values
P=np.ones((13,56))
Y=data[:,45]
for i in range (1,12):
X= np.column_stack((P,(dat[:,i])))
Xt = np.transpose(X)
p=np.matmul(Xt,X)But the code gives me the below error message:Traceback (most recent call last):
File "proj.py", line 1, in <module>
data =pandas.read_csv('valla',nov=',')
NameError: name 'pandas' is not definedIs there anything wrong with my code or the problem is with the file I was trying to read?If there is any thing wrong in my code what is that and how to solve that.Thanks in advance.

Solution:At first maske sure the file you are calling does exists. And please import numpy and pandas before using those functions:import pandas
import numpy as np I imported numpy as np because in your code you called numpy as np:import pandas
import numpy as np
data =pandas.read_csv('valla',nov=',')
data=data.values
P=np.ones((13,56))
Y=data[:,45]
for i in range (1,12):
X= np.column_stack((P,(dat[:,i])))
Xt = np.transpose(X)
p=np.matmul(Xt,X)Hope you understand what the error was in your program. Happy coding.
