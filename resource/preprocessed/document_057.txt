jonclements adjusted quite inconsistent case numbers powers martijn pieters oct add comment answers active oldest votes problem line number list cow n tries take cow n returns integer make list work demonstrated list traceback recent call last file line typeerror int object iterable perhaps meant put cow n inside list number cow n see demonstration also wanted address two things statement missing end considered dangerous use input like since evaluates input real python code would better use raw_input convert input integer int split digits add like want would first make number string since strings iterable use sum str way common preferred sum int x x also works sum map int share improve answer follow edited oct answered oct user user thanks answering quickly would split number individual characters tried putting list number beneath causes run forever run terminal user oct integers characters however could convert string str might need convert list depending intend strings iterable yield constituent characters kindall oct mikey see edit could use loop quickest option use sum user oct great guys thank much started learning code still confused repeat get repeat without using loop example say user want look digits must work e g sum integers sum integers user oct mikey hmm might use loop however since topic question typeerror post fixes first close question answered click tick next answer ask another question focuses problem particular get better help way definitely make number string first though split digits user oct show comment simple trying convert integer
