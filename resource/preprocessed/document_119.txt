[Error] Laravel 6 php artisan make:auth command not defined! [Solved] | Parth Patel - a Web DeveloperMenuBlogPHPLaravelHOMELARAVEL[Error] Laravel 6 php artisan make:auth command not defined! [Solved]By Parth Patel on Feb 13, 2020Laravel 6 is out! And it brought bunch of improvements with it. But also as this is a major version upgrade, there are some breaking changes. One such major change is the removal ofphp artisan make:auth
php artisan make:auth commandThe make:auth artisan command helps to quickly scaffold the entire authentication system with one command. You will get login and registration functionalities, password reset function along with related blade view pages.The make:auth command will work for Laravel framework verson below 6 i.e 5.8,5.9 . But v6.0 onwards, it won't work.But in Laravel 6.0, Taylor decided to remove it from the Laravel core and offer this feature as standalone package called laravel/ui. The main reason behind this is that Laravel doesn't want to decide which css or javascript framework you should use. Thus, it remains framework agnostic for front-end development. Thus, laravel/ui package offers presets for popular frameworks like bootstrap/jquery, tailwindcss, vue.js and can be installed easily.Install laravel/ui package through composer by following command:composer require laravel/ui --devNow you can install auth component for various presets (run any 1 command from below accordingly) :php artisan ui bootstrap --auth
php artisan ui vue --auth
php artisan ui react --authAfter running the above command, it will generate UI files respectively in resources folder. Now run npm install to install javascript dependencies:npm installOnce the dependencies has been installed, you can compile css and javascript via npm run dev/prod (dev if development env , prod if for production):npm run devThis is how you can generate auth scaffolding in your Laravel application. Let me know in the comments how do you like the new version of Laravel.AdiosCopyright 2020. All rights reserved.TwitterGithubLinkedin
