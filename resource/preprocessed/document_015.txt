The problem is that train_test_split(X, y, ...) returns numpy arrays and not pandas dataframes. Numpy arrays have no attribute named columns
If you want to see what features SelectFromModel kept, you need to substitute X_train (which is a numpy.array) with X which is a pandas.DataFrame.
selected_feat= X.columns[(sel.get_support())]
This will return a list of the columns kept by the feature selector.
If you wanted to see how many features were kept you can just run this:
sel.get_support().sum()
# by default this will count 'True' as 1 and 'False' as 0

because this :
X = df.iloc[:,:24481].values
y = df.iloc[:, -1].values
you should remove .values or make extra X_col, y_col like that
X_col = df.iloc[:,:24481]
y_col = df.iloc[:, -1]
