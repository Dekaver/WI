This question already has answers here:
Artisan command “make:auth” is not defined in Laravel 6
(9 answers)
Closed 1 year ago.
I wanted to create a new project so I can fiddle with the authentication a bit, see what I could do. However, when I tried to run the make:auth command, I got an error.
I decided to look in the composer.json file to see if I maybe had an outdated Composer version, but I saw the updated laravel/framework.
I can't find anything about the make:auth command being removed on so I thought I'd come here and ask about it.
Command "make:auth" is not defined.
Did you mean one of these?
make:channel
make:command
make:controller
make:event
make:exception
make:factory
make:job
make:listener
make:mail
make:middleware
make:migration
make:model
make:notification
make:observer
make:policy
make:provider
make:request
make:resource
make:rule
make:seeder
make:test

First Install the laravel/ui Composer package with the following command:
composer require laravel/ui
and then run the following command in a new
Laravel application:
php artisan ui vue --auth
Laravel 6 has moved the Auth Scaffolding into a seperate package.

Yes in Laravel 6 auth command has been removed and authentication scaffolding has been moved as separate package named laravel/ui
Here you can read about Laravel 6 and laravel/ui and also here you can read about laravel/ui in laravel documentation
