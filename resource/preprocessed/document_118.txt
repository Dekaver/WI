Discord PY TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to strdiscord.py, python / By
LopeKinz
i am trying to make my own level
bot
but i am getting : TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
This is my Code:
@client.event
async def on_message(message):
for badword in file:
if badword in message.content.lower():
await message.delete()
await message.channel.send(f'{message.author.mention}! Your message has not passed moderation!')
else:
await client.process_commands(message)
with open("users.json","r") as f:
users = json.load(f)
lvl = users[str(message.author.id)]
error-> sum = lvl + 1
with open("users.json", "r") as f:
users = json.load(f)
users[str(message.author.id)] = sum
with open("users.json", "w") as f:
json.dump(users, f, indent=4)
and this is my json :
{
"763339711988236328" : "0"
}
how can i get the "0"
and add "1" to make the user level up?
like:
{
"763339711988236328" : "7"
}
7 +
1 = 8
After :
{
"763339711988236328" : "8"
}
sorry for my bad english i am from germany
