What causes this error in my code?
$query = $this->db->query("SELECT * FROM tour_foreign ORDER BY id desc");
$data = array();
foreach ($query->result() as $row)
$data[] = array('guide' => $row->guide);
echo json_decode($data); //Line 167
error:
erro: json_decode() expects parameter 1 to be string, array given: Line Number: 167
UPDATE:
If I use json_encode instead of json_decode, my output is this:
[{"guide":["\u0633\u06cc\u062f \u0633\u0639\u06cc\u062f \u062f\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0634\u0632\u0627\u062f\u0647"]},{"guide":["\u0633\u06c‌​c\u062f \u0633\u0639\u06cc\u062f \u062f\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0634\u0632\u0627\u062f\u0647"]},{"guide":null}]
They are persian words.

You are passing an array where a string is expected. You are creating the array in the line before - is that necessary? Why not just use $row->guide directly?

I think you want json_encode, not json_decode.

@Selena: The \u0633 characters are just Unicode characters that are encoded.
The first guide is سید سعید داداشزاده.
Is that right?

@Selena: Show it where?
If you echo the string (in JavaScript) they will print correctly.
You don't need to do anything special, just echo them normally.

Set decoding to true
Your decoding is not set to true.
If you don't have access to set the source to true. The code below will fix it for you.
$WorkingArray = json_decode(json_encode($data),true);

json_decode() is used to decode a json string to an array/data object. json_encode() creates a json string from an array or data. You are using the wrong function my friend, try json_encode();

Ok I was running into the same issue. What I failed to notice is that I was using json_decode() instead of using json_encode() so for those who are going to come here please make sure you are using the right function, which is json_encode()
Note: Depends on what you are working on but make sure you are using the right function.
