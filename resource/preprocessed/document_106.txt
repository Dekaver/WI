Warning: openssl_encrypt() expects parameter 1 to be string, object given in D:\filephp\blockchain\testblock.php on line 31Blockchain, Encryption, php, sha256 / By
Arash Ahmad
I want to try to make a simple voting system with blockchain. I want to encrypt and decrypt the voter data. The decryption is for the voter to verify their voted data. But I have a problem with encryption.
Class Block in 'testblock.php'
function __construct($index, $timestamp, $serverid, $voterid, $candidateid, $previousHash = null)
{
$this->index = $index;
$this->timestamp = $timestamp;
$this->serverid = $serverid;
$this->voterid = $voterid;
$this->candidateid = $candidateid;
$this->previousHash = $previousHash;
$this->output = $this->encrypt_decrypt($action = null, $string = null, $output = null);
$this->nonce = 0;
}
public function encrypt_decrypt($action = null, $string = null, $output = null)
{
$output = false;
$encrypt_method = "AES-256-CBC";
$key = hash('sha256', $this->index.$this->timestamp.$this->serverid.$this->voterid.((string)$this->candidateid).$this->previousHash.$this->nonce);
$iv = substr(hash('sha256', $this->index.$this->timestamp.$this->serverid.$this->voterid.((string)$this->candidateid).$this->previousHash.$this->timestamp.$this->nonce), 0, 16);
if ($action == 'encrypt')
{
$output = openssl_encrypt($string, $encrypt_method, $key, 0, $iv); //line 30
$output = base64_encode($output);
}
else if ($action == 'decrypt')
{
$output = openssl_decrypt(base64_decode($string), $encrypt_method, $key, 0, $iv);
}
return $output;
}
Class BlockChain in 'testblockchain.php'
public function push($block)
{
$block->previousHash = $this->getLastBlock()->output;
$this->mine($block);
array_push($this->chain, $block);
}
public function mine($block)
{
while (substr($block->output, 0, $this->difficulty) !== str_repeat("0", $this->difficulty)) {
$block->nonce++;
$block->output = $block->encrypt_decrypt('encrypt');
}
echo "Block mined: ".$block->output."\n";
}
Retrieve data from database in 'testchain.php'
$testCoin = new BlockChain();
while($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result)){
echo "mining block\n";
$testCoin->push(new Block($row['id'], $row['timestamp'], $row['serverid'], $row['voterid'], $row['candidateid']));
echo json_encode($testCoin, JSON_PRETTY_PRINT);
}
