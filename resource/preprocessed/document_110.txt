String concatenate TypeError: can only concatenate str (not “int”) to str"
(3 answers)
Closed 12 months ago.
I decided to make some kind of secret code for testing purposes with Unicode.
I've done that by adding numbers to Unicode so it would be kind of secret.
I've been getting this error, but I don't know how to solve it.
Is there any solution?
Original Code
message = input("Enter a message you want to be revealed: ")
secret_string = ""
for char in message:
secret_string += str(chr(char + 7429146))
print("Revealed", secret_string)
q = input("")
Original Error
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError
Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-182-49ece294a581> in <module>
2 secret_string = ""
3 for char in message:
----> 4
secret_string += str(chr(char + 7429146))
5 print("Revealed", secret_string)
6 q = input("")
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
Updated code
while True:
try:
message = int(input("Enter a message you want to be decrypt: "))
break
except ValueError:
print("Error, it must be an integer")
secret_string = ""
for char in message:
secret_string += chr(ord(char - str(742146)))
print("Decrypted", secret_string)
q = input("")

What did you want char + 7429146 to mean?

change char + 7429146 into char + str(7429146). You cannot concatenate string and int

You're getting that error because of the line secret_string += str(chr(char + 7429146)) you have to cast that integer in order to concatenate it with char variable: secret_string += str(chr(char + str(7429146)))

Python working a bit differently to JavaScript for example, the value you are concatenating needs to be same type, both int or str...
So for example the code below throw an error:
print( "Alireza" + 1980)
like this:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<pyshell#12>", line 1, in <module>
print( "Alireza" + 1980)
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
To solve the issue, just add str to your number or value like:
print( "Alireza" + str(1980))
And the result as:
Alireza1980

instead of using " + " operator
print( "Alireza" + 1980)
Use comma " , " operator
print( "Alireza" , 1980)

print( "Alireza" , 1980) outputs Alireza 1980 with an extra space between.

To avoid the extra space it is possible to override the default value of the sep argument: print("Alireza" , 1980, sep='')

This only works for print since it takes an unlimited number of arguments to print. It doesn't work in the general case of trying to concatenate a string with an integer.

Use f-strings to resolve the TypeError
f-Strings: A New and Improved Way to Format Strings in Python
PEP 498 - Literal String Interpolation
# the following line causes a TypeError
# test = 'Here is a test that can be run' + 15 + 'times'
# same intent with a f-string
i = 15
test = f'Here is a test that can be run {i} times'
print(test)
# output
'Here is a test that can be run 15 times'
i = 15
# t = 'test' + i
# will cause a TypeError
# should be
t = f'test{i}'
print(t)
# output
'test15'
The issue may be attempting to evaluate an expression where a variable is the string of a numeric.
Convert the string to an int.
This scenario is specific to this question
When iterating, it's important to be aware of the dtype
i = '15'
# t = 15 + i
# will cause a TypeError
# convert the string to int
t = 15 + int(i)
print(t)
# output
30
Note
The preceding part of the answer addresses the TypeError shown in the question title, which is why people seem to be coming to this question.
However, this doesn't resolve the issue in relation to the example provided by the OP, which is addressed below.
Original Code Issues
TypeError is caused because message type is a str.
The code iterates each character and attempts to add char, a str type, to an int
That issue can be resolved by converting char to an int
As the code is presented, secret_string needs to be initialized with 0 instead of "".
The code also results in a ValueError: chr() arg not in range(0x110000) because 7429146 is out of range for chr().
Resolved by using a smaller number
The output is not a string, as was intended, which leads to the Updated Code in the question.
message = input("Enter a message you want to be revealed: ")
secret_string = 0
for char in message:
char = int(char)
value = char + 742146
secret_string += ord(chr(value))
print(f'\nRevealed: {secret_string}')
# Output
Enter a message you want to be revealed:
999
Revealed: 2226465
Updated Code Issues
message is now an int type, so for char in message: causes TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
message is converted to int to make sure the input is an int.
Set the type with str()
Only convert value to Unicode with chr
Don't use ord
while True:
try:
message = str(int(input("Enter a message you want to be decrypt: ")))
break
except ValueError:
print("Error, it must be an integer")
secret_string = ""
for char in message:
value = int(char) + 10000
secret_string += chr(value)
print("Decrypted", secret_string)
# output
Enter a message you want to be decrypt:
999
Decrypted ✙✙✙
Enter a message you want to be decrypt:
100
Decrypted ✑✐✐

Change secret_string += str(chr(char + 7429146))
To secret_string += chr(ord(char) + 7429146)
ord() converts the character to its Unicode integer equivalent. chr() then converts this integer into its Unicode character equivalent.
Also, 7429146 is too big of a number, it should be less than 1114111

@InAFlash My answer is different because I have removed the str() from the outside and added an ord() inside

Use this:
print("Program for calculating sum")
numbers=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
sum=0
for number in numbers:
sum += number
print("Total Sum is: %d" %sum )

Problem is you are doing the following
str(chr(char + 7429146))
where char is a string. You cannot add a int with a string. this will cause that error
maybe if you want to get the ascii code and add it with a constant number. if so , you can just do ord(char) and add it to a number. but again, chr can take values between 0 and 1114112
