python: AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'Append'
Hi
I am working on a Wxpython application, where I create buttons and then want to destroy all the buttons again, so I can display others (like in a main menu)
To keep track of what objects have to be destroy()ed, I want to add them to a list:
code:
----------------
self.term_list = []
self.chords_button = wx.Button(self.panel, label="Train Chords")
self.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.chords, self.chords_button)
self.term_list.Append(self.chords_button)
On this, Python drops the error,
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'Append'
which does not make sense, because lists always has a append attribute, right?
Stumped...
Markus

Right, no "Append" but "append". Case-sensitive.

blast, you are right!!
Did I miss something here? I thought python is case insensitive?
Or only certain things are case sensivite?

No, I think it's all case-sensitive.
Most programming languages nowadays are.
There aren't Java-like restrictions on how you name classes and modules, though.
