Cannot Import Data using Pandas
0 votes
So, I tried to work through the following machine learning tutorial:
http://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/
This is my (mac) development environment:
Python 2.7.10
scipy: 0.13.0b1
numpy: 1.8.0rc1
matplotlib: 1.3.1
pandas: 0.20.2
sklearn: 0.18.1
When I try to run a script, to load the data from a URL containing the CSV data, I get the following error:
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "load_data.py", line 4, in <module>
dataset = pandas.read_csv(url, names=names)
NameError: name 'pandas' is not defined
Here's the script:
# Load dataset
url = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data"
names = ['sepal-length', 'sepal-width', 'petal-length', 'petal-width', 'class']
dataset = pandas.read_csv(url, names=names)

Hi. I had forgotten to import pandas library. I imported the library before my code and it worked fine:
import pandas

So< if your error says:
dataset = pandas.read_csv(url, names=names)
NameError: name 'pandas' is not defined
It probably means you're trying to use pandas.read_csv() without importing Pandas first.When you want to use an external library, you have to import it. if it's not installed on your machine, you may have to install it first too. assuming pandas is installed on your machine, this code will work:
import pandas
url = "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data"
names = ['sepal-length', 'sepal-width', 'petal-length', 'petal-width', 'class']
dataset = pandas.read_csv(url, names=names)
output:
dataset.head(3)
sepal-length
sepal-width
petal-length
petal-width

You are trying to import the pandas module but it is not installed on your system. To install pandas run the below command in the terminal:
pip install pandas
