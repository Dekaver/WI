I was trying to scrap a website for practice, but I kept on getting the HTTP Error 403 (does it think I'm a bot)?Here is my code:#import requests
import urllib.request
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
#from urllib import urlopen
import re
webpage = urllib.request.urlopen('http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/products/#sortField=oi&sortAsc=false&venues=3&page=1&cleared=1&group=1').read
findrows = re.compile('<tr class="- banding(?:On|Off)>(.*?)</tr>')
findlink = re.compile('<a href =">(.*)</a>')
row_array = re.findall(findrows, webpage)
links = re.finall(findlink, webpate)
print(len(row_array))
iterator = []

This is probably because of mod_security or some similar server security feature which blocks known spider/bot user agents (urllib uses something like python urllib/3.3.0, it's easily detected). Try setting a known browser user agent with:from urllib.request import Request, urlopen
req = Request('http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/products/#sortField=oi&sortAsc=false&venues=3&page=1&cleared=1&group=1', headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'})
webpage = urlopen(req).read()
This works for me.By the way, in your code you are missing the () after .read in the urlopen line, but I think that it's a typo.TIP: since this is exercise, choose a different, non restrictive site. Maybe they are blocking urllib for some reason...

Definitely it's blocking because of your use of urllib based on the user agent. This same thing is happening to me with OfferUp. You can create a new class called AppURLopener which overrides the user-agent with Mozilla. import urllib.request
class AppURLopener(urllib.request.FancyURLopener):
version = "Mozilla/5.0"
opener = AppURLopener()
response = opener.open('http://httpbin.org/user-agent')

HTTP error 403 in Python 3 Web Scraping, HTTP error 403 in Python 3 Web Scraping. I was trying to scrap a website for practice, but I kept on getting the HTTP Error 403 (does it think I'm a bot)?.
Using urllib.request.urlopen() to open a website when crawling, and encounters “HTTP Error 403: Forbidden”. It possibly due to the server does not know the request is coming from. Some websites
"This is probably because of mod_security or some similar server security feature which blocks known
spider/bot
user agents (urllib uses something like python urllib/3.3.0, it's easily detected)" - as already mentioned by Stefano Sanfilippofrom urllib.request import Request, urlopen
url="https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=html+error+403"
req = Request(url, headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'})
web_byte = urlopen(req).read()
webpage = web_byte.decode('utf-8')
The web_byte is a byte object returned by the server and the content type present in webpage is mostly utf-8.
Therefore you need to decode web_byte using decode method.This solves complete problem while I was having trying to scrap from a website using PyCharm P.S -> I use python 3.4
urllib.error.HTTPError: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden · Issue #399 , Hi all, I'm aware that there are some older issues with the same error,
/​questions/16627227/http-error-403-in-python-3-web-scraping but I'm  HTTP Status Code 403 definitely means Forbidden / Access Denied. HTTP Status Code 302 is for redirection of requests. No need to worry about them. Nothing seems to be wrong in your code. Yes, it's definitely an anti-scraping measure implemented by the site. Refer these guidelines from Scrapy Docs: Avoid Getting Banned
Since the page works in browser and not when calling within python program, it seems that the web app that serves that url recognizes that you request the content not by the browser.Demonstration:curl --dump-header r.txt http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/products/#sortField=oi&sortAsc=false&venues=3&page=1&cleared=1&group=1
...
<HTML><HEAD>
<TITLE>Access Denied</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>
<H1>Access Denied</H1>
You don't have permission to access ...
</HTML>
and the content in r.txt has status line:HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Try posting header 'User-Agent' which fakes web client.NOTE: The page contains Ajax call that creates the table you probably want to parse. You'll need to check the javascript logic of the page or simply using browser debugger (like Firebug / Net tab) to see which url you need to call to get the table's content.

Our first request gets a 403 response that’s ignored and then everything shuts down because we only seeded the crawl with one URL. The same request works fine in a web browser, even in incognito mode with no session history, so this has to be caused by some difference in the request headers.

CommentsI assume it's safe to reuse req for multiple urlopen calls.It might be little late, but I already have User-Agent in my code, still it gives me Error 404: Access deniedThis works but I feel like they must have a good reason to block bots and I'm violating their terms of serviceThe top answer didn't work for me, while yours did. Thanks a lot!This works just fine but I need to attach the ssl configuration to this. How do I do this? Before I just added it as a second parameter (urlopen(request,context=ctx))looks like it did open but it says 'ValueError: read of closed file'@zeta How did you manage to scrape OfferUp and provide the requisite geo coordinates to perform the search from a script?@CJTravis , I wasn't scraping OfferUp. I was just retrieving item values based on an exact URL of an item. That didn't require any geo coordinates for me
