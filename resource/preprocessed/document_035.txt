Hi,
I wrote the following code and receiving error. What is problem with and how can I eradicate errors.
c=0
x=[]
y=[]
z=[]
while True:
o=int(input("enter menu:"))
if o==1:
x.append(input("enter name:"))
z.append(int(input("enter #:")))
y.append(int(input("enter score:")))
c+=1
elif o==2:
n=int(input("enter student number:"))
for i in range(0,c):
if n==z[i]:
x.pop([i])
y.pop([i])
z.pop([i])
elif o==3:
for i in range(0,c):
print("name:",x[i],"st number:",z[i],"score:",y[i])
elif o==4:
break
I received TypeError: ‘list’ object cannot be interpreted as an integer for x.pop([i])
then I changed that to x.pop(x[i]) and I received
TypeError: ‘str’ object cannot be interpreted as an integer

Did you try with just pop(i).?
Generally speaking, if we only wish to delete without returning the value,
del(x[i])
will do the same thing.

Thanks for your valuable answer.I replace pop with del, but I get that error again.
The thing which is strange for me is that I am using the same definition for remove as same as find, but I only receive error from remove.
Meanwhile, there is a problem with finding maximum on o=2. Please take a look at my run below:
o=1:::add o=2:::max o=3:::find o=4:::remove o=5:::report
o=6:::exit enter menu:1
enter name:sam enter #:5 enter score:90
o=1:::add o=2:::max o=3:::find o=4:::remove o=5:::report
o=6:::exit enter menu:1
enter name:susan enter #:10 enter score:75
o=1:::add o=2:::max o=3:::find o=4:::remove o=5:::report
o=6:::exit enter menu:1
enter name:peter enter #:2 enter score:80
o=1:::add o=2:::max o=3:::find o=4:::remove o=5:::report
o=6:::exit enter menu:5
name: sam st number: 5 score: 90 name: susan st number: 10 score: 75 name: peter st number: 2 score: 80
o=1:::add o=2:::max o=3:::find o=4:::remove o=5:::report
o=6:::exit enter menu:2
max= 90
o=1:::add o=2:::max o=3:::find o=4:::remove o=5:::report
o=6:::exit enter menu:5
name: sam st number: 5 score: 90 name: susan st number: 10 score: 90 name: peter st number: 2 score: 90
o=1:::add o=2:::max o=3:::find o=4:::remove o=5:::report
o=6:::exit enter menu:6
You can see when I enter report as the first time, I will have true results. When I use max after that I find maximum number, although when I use again report you can see that I get false results(the score of sam, susan and peter are changed to 90 all of them) How can I eradicate this problem?
