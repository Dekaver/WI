How can I read inputs as numbers?
(10 answers)
Closed 1 year ago.
I don't understand what the problem is with the code, it is very simple so this is an easy one.
x = input("Give starting number: ")
y = input("Give ending number: ")
for i in range(x,y):
print(i)
It gives me an error
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "C:/Python33/harj4.py", line 6, in <module>
for i in range(x,y):
TypeError: 'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer
As an example, if x is 3 and y is 14,
I want it to print
Give starting number: 4
Give ending number: 13

A simplest fix would be:
x = input("Give starting number: ")
y = input("Give ending number: ")
x = int(x)
# parse string into an integer
y = int(y)
# parse string into an integer
for i in range(x,y):
print(i)
input returns you a string (raw_input in Python 2). int tries to parse it into an integer. This code will throw an exception if the string doesn't contain a valid integer string, so you'd probably want to refine it a bit using try/except statements.

You are getting the error because range() only takes int values as parameters.
Try using int() to convert your inputs.

x = int(input("Give starting number: "))
y = int(input("Give ending number: "))
P.S. Add function int()

x = int(input("Give starting number: "))
y = int(input("Give ending number: "))
for i in range(x, y):
print(i)

I'm guessing you're running python3, in which input(prompt) returns a string.
Try this.
x=int(input('prompt'))
y=int(input('prompt'))

In python2, use int(raw_input('prompt'))

You have to convert input x and y into int like below.
x=int(x)
y=int(y)

You will have to put:
X = input("give starting number")
X = int(X)
Y = input("give ending number")
Y = int(Y)

Or you can also use eval(input('prompt')).

eval() will convert the expression to an evaluated version of the input.This is used to counter the backward non-compatiblity of python 3 against Python 2.

I used this in my program for factorial which was not working before(error given was : for i in range(1,n+1): TypeError: must be str, not int)
and it worked:
n = eval(input("Enter a number: ")) j=1 for i in range(1,n+1):
j=j*i
i=i+1 print(j)

This may work... But it creates an enormous security flaw, an attacker has quite literally free reign when you run eval like this without first properly checking the string...
